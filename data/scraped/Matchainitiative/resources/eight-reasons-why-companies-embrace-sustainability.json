Consumers ask for more transparency on where and how the products are made and try to limit their ecological footprint and impact on the environment. They buy products that emit less CO2 such as plant-based meat, they also buy locally sourced organic products. So for BtoC, it's becoming a minimal criteria to attract customers as well as to keep up with competition."

Millennials and Generation Z want a job where they feel there is a sense of purpose towards people and the planet. Professional services firms whose business model relies on selling their talent through advice and counselling have been the first movers, to keep an edge on talent acquisition. The Deloitte Millennial Survey 2018 shows that culture is one of the top priorities of millennials when considering an employer. Talents are moving where sustainability is at the core of the action plans and they want to be actively engaged."

        "description": "Many large companies which have implemented sustainability strategies now give special attention to their whole ecosystem and to their supply chain in particular. In practice, this is translated in specific sustainability requests for suppliers, such as assigning Supplier Code of Conducts, answering ESG assessments (such as EcoVadis or in-house questionnaires…), and conducting on-site audits. Many SMEs started their sustainability journey after not being able to answer sustainability questions for tenders or losing a tender where the only criteria they didn't fill was related to sustainability."

The financial sector has responded to the change in attitudes from the public and financial institutions have started to support green and sustainability-linked projects through financial products and services (loans, bonds, insurance, funds). GreenBanks in a sense can be seen as an accelerating factor for companies to move towards sustainability as they have the power to blacklist companies and activities if they find them not \"green\" enough or they can help companies become truly sustainable by financing their needs to meet ESG criteria."
