  "type": "Resource Page - Fundamentals",
  "summary": "Guide explaining the difference between energy efficiency (technological improvements) and energy conservation (behavioral/operational changes), with focus on building optimization strategies and predictive control systems.",
  "key_concepts": {
    "energy_efficiency": "Replacing equipment with more efficient alternatives (e.g., LED lightbulbs)",
    "energy_conservation": "Reducing energy use through behavioral changes (e.g., turning off lights)",
    "predictive_control": "Software that anticipates conditions and adjusts equipment operation in advance"
  },
  "main_problems": [
    "Modern buildings are efficient but wasteful (e.g., overcooling malls)",
    "Difficulty measuring conservation progress due to external factors",
    "Government incentives favor efficiency over conservation",
    "Tendency to replace rather than optimize existing equipment"
  ],
  "conservation_strategies": [
    "Education & change of habits (closing windows during heating)",
    "Reassessing actual needs (lights at 3am?)",
    "Smart & dynamic control systems",
    "Predictive control software"
  ],
  "measurement_challenges": {
    "issue": "Hard to quantify conservation when external factors (like COVID) affect consumption",
    "solution": "Internationally recognized standards for building reference baselines"
  },
  "equipment_lifecycle": {
    "chiller_lifespan": "15-20 years",
    "problem": "Replacing after 5 years for newer models is unsustainable",
    "better_approach": "Optimize existing equipment first"
  },
  "software_advantages": [
    "Simple interfacing with existing equipment",
    "No operational interruptions",
    "No significant hardware investment required",
    "Combines efficiency and conservation benefits"
  ],
  "key_insight": "Even the most modern and efficient facilities have room for improvement through proper energy conservation strategies",
