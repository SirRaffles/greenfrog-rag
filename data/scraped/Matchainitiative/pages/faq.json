        "question": "Is the platform created sustainably?",
        "answer": "All TMI team members are aware of their footprint. Unfortunately it was not always possible for us to make sustainable choices. For instance, our website is built on Webflow. But Webflow only allows us to be hosted on AWS, which is not the most sustainable choice. Our next steps consist in switching to a more sustainable host, measure our carbon footprint and find a good way to offset it."
