    "introduction": "Over the past ten years, I have gradually developed my expertise to put my convictions into action, focusing my energy in increasing circularity. I have been passionately involved in collaborating with private companies and public authorities to advance circular economy initiatives and implement Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Schemes. I played instrumental roles in developing and implementing strategic roadmaps to establish EPR schemes dedicated to industrial and commercial packaging in France. My motivation is to work among various stakeholders and to help shift an industry as a whole, and to re-invent economy with more re-use and more re-cycling.",
