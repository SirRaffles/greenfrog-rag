  "introduction": "I am the founder of Sustainao, a sustainability consulting firm based in Singapore. With 10 years of experience in the field, I help businesses develop impactful sustainability and decarbonisation strategies, embed sustainable practices into operations, and report their performance to stakeholders in a meaningful way.

  "top_3_advice": ["Knowledge is power. Understanding the whole picture, what matters the most for your business and your stakeholders will make your sustainability journey more efficient and relevant, and it will also help you better convince others.", "You need support. Sustainability is meant to be transversal in a company. Try to bring together all departments, like obviously the general management, the human resources management, HSE management (if applicable), but also don't forget about communication and PR, legal, production, purchasing, sales, marketing and R&D.", "Measure your performance and set targets. Implement KPIs and set targets for your material issues, and choose adequate tools and methodology from the beginning of the reporting process to collect and analyse the data you obtain."],

  "sustainability_journey": "My journey into sustainability started with a BSc in Chemistry and Biology, followed by a Master's in Environmental Science. From there, moving into sustainability felt like a natural next step. But my connection to the environment goes back much further. I grew up surrounded by nature—literally. My family lived in a forest for several years while my father worked as a forest ranger. That early exposure instilled in me a deep sense of environmental stewardship. Looking back, it's hard to say whether I chose sustainability or it chose me.",
  "sustainable_actions": "I started Sustainao to make sustainability more practical and achievable for companies. We help them navigate complexity by focusing on what matters most, setting clear goals and building momentum step by step. Our team works across a wide range of themes, from ESG benchmarking and strategy development to technical areas like carbon accounting and sustainable procurement. We also focus on enabling cross-functional integration of sustainability, helping clients embed it across different departments. Internally, I prioritise fostering a healthy and supportive workplace.",
  "challenges_overcome": "Two of my biggest challenges in sustainability are its broad scope—covering a wide range of interconnected topics—and the diverse group of stakeholders involved, each with different priorities and expectations. I manage this by using materiality and risk assessments to identify priorities, then working across departments to align actions. Involving the right people from the start and tailoring messages to different roles helps ensure sustainability is integrated across the organisation.",
  "most_proud_of": "I feel a deep sense of satisfaction when our clients are recognised for their sustainability efforts, whether through awards or ESG ratings. What's even more meaningful, however, is seeing real outcomes for people on the ground. For example, hearing stories of female students receiving scholarships as a result of a client's program or witnessing a reduction in a customer's GHG emissions.",
