  "sustainability_journey": "About 7 years ago, I got my wake-up call to the environmental challenges we are facing. While learning to surf at a beach in the region, I found myself paddling through trash — bottles and packaging were floating alongside me. This moment sparked my search for more sustainable ways to live. I had the privilege of learning about sustainability in my previous work and today, I'm proud to be able to integrate my personal commitment with my professional work by advancing sustainable living at Ecoworks.",
  "sustainable_actions": "I have been involved in crafting a sustainable business model and facilitating partnerships at Ecoworks.",
  "challenges_overcome": "When introducing a new concept, you get more NO's than a simple YES. I've overcome the rejections by applying an empathetic lens in discussions, and working to achieve a win-win outcome for everyone. I also acknowledge small wins' value in paving the way for bigger wins.",
