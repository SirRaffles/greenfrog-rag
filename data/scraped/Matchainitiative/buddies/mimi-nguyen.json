    "introduction": "I was born in Vietnam and grew up in France in Paris' low income suburbs. My parents used to bring us to the park to have some outdoor activities and that's where my father taught my siblings and I to observe, love and respect nature. He gave us perspective on our place in a much bigger ecosystem. In 2018 in Singapore, after what felt like a long, unfulfilling professional tunnel on autopilot, I was forced to make a pause and took the opportunity to consider what I really wanted to do with my life. Then I really realised how passionate I was about sustainability and for the first time, I considered making it my job. Nothing is easy when you don't hold the right degrees or the right amount of money, so I co-created The Matcha Initiative to jump into action instead of procrastinating.",
    "top_advice": [
      "Action is the cure to eco-anxiety and overthinking paralysis.",
      "Change comes from within and spreads out; start with yourself and influence your own world little by little. Be patient and kind to yourself, to others, to strangers, in that journey :)",
      "Be a humble learner, keep learning. Use knowledge as a lever of positive change."
    ],
    "bonus_advice": "I'd like to add that it took grit to get me where I am today, but not only: I could achieve it because I had the financial support of my partner during those 2 years not earning a salary. I'm fully aware of my luck and that not everyone can afford doing this. So wherever you stand, do what you can, with what you have.",
    "how_can_help": "I can share my experience of transition, the challenges of a start up, the basics of sustainability (and why we should move to regeneration), what you can do on a personal level, how companies should and can move away from the carbon tunnel vision.",
    "expertise_areas": [
      "Green office",
      "Sustainable HR Practices", 
      "Carbon Management & Carbon Footprint",
      "Local Community Involvement - CSR - Philanthropy",
      "Corporate Governance, Mission & Strategy",
      "Responsible Marketing"
    ],
    "company_description": "Handprint is a 'ClimateTech', we provide digital solutions to channel companies' ESG budgets to the organisations and projects of their choice. Our main differentiators are the diversity of our impact portfolio (if we want to tackle the climate crisis we need to move beyond carbon), the direct relationship we create with the impact organisations (bringing back human and emotional connections), our 2 PhDs and co-founders behind the Regeneration First Manifesto (our tools are science-based) and the services we provide to businesses in order to effectively engage their stakeholders on their ESG initiatives.",
    "role_and_responsibilities": "I joined the company in its early days and have been wearing multiple hats. I'm currently their General Manager, with a focus on People & Culture, Ops and Performance. I'm proud to contribute to a real positive impact, within the company and with our impact partners :)",
    "startup_challenges": "We're a fully remote company created during the pandemic, which has both pros and cons when it comes to a sustainable way of working. Remote meaning 10 different countries, not just working from home. The hardest part is probably creating and maintaining meaningful and authentic human connections, which is key if you want to have happy people making a positive impact at scale.",
    "tmi_significance": "The Matcha Initiative represents a lot to me: It's my turning point into a place where I feel aligned with what I do. It's a humble project to kickstart something that matters, where I stand and with what I know. It was a unique experience managing volunteers remotely during lockdowns! It's an everlasting opportunity to learn and meet incredible, knowledgeable people. It's a lot of time, hard work and energy that I gave without thinking twice and it's worth it.",
    "proudest_achievement": "I'm a builder, I'm proud of The Matcha Initiative and of Handprint. The journeys themselves made me grow as a person and I believe I brought a few people along the way with me.",
