  "sustainability_journey": "I started my career in procurement where I was purchasing gigantic amounts of 'Stuff' that was used once and thrown away. Very quickly I started to implement new ideas to reduce waste or lengthen the usage of products. Then I focused on the manufacturing side, how to use less materials, reduce wastage, optimize energy and water efficiency, etc...",
  "implemented_actions": "I have worked on several closed loop recycling programs and developed products to increase life cycle and increase recyclability. Then I started to look into scope 3 and mainly our manufacturing partners. The main tasks were to define 'how to': quantify, monitor and reduce scope 3 emissions. A lot of this started with workers engagement programs with R&D, production and quality teams.",
  "challenges_faced": "Quality is a main issue when trying to replace materials in a product, but I think also marketing is an issue as brands have marketed the same way for decades and it is difficult to change mindset.",
  "solutions_approach": "Reducing our consumption and being smart with recycling are key. I believe our really challenge is to phase out Fossil fuel and this will be sparked by innovation.",
