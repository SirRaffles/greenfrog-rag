    "introduction": "As a sustainability professional, my core motivation is to maximise impact. As an educator, my focus is on meaningful engagement. Therefore, I design and deliver collaborative, science-based learning experiences that support organisations on their journey towards sustainability and making a positive impact. My approach is grounded by 15 years in learner-centred education and formal sustainability training at UCLA.",
    "top_3_advice": [
      "Don't think about sustainability as a field - it's a layer on top of a field (e.g. sustainability education, green finance, etc.).",
      "Frustration is very much part of the game - embrace it and draw inspiration from it.",
      "Reach out - there are plenty of well-meaning people out there to talk to."
    ],
    "how_to_help": "I'm assuming a lot of people coming here are pivoting into sustainability, just like I did a couple of years ago. I am happy to share my experiences, and just be one of the people out here you can talk to!",

    "sustainability_motivation": "I was drawn to sustainability mostly for selfish reasons: To make the world a livable place for my son, and to make a career switch from teaching, which I was pretty much burned out doing.",
    "organizational_responsibilities": "I am in charge of governance, training, and cultural and behavioural change.",
    "challenges_and_solutions": "It was challenging pivoting to a new industry and starting as an outsider. I have realised that excitement is a must to succeed, and that frustration is (sadly) normal.",
    "proudest_achievement": "I am most proud to have designed some pretty successful learning experiences, and see participants not using TikTok during my workshops!",
