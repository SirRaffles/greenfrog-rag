  "sustainability_journey": "Prior to my startup, I was the Sustainability Leader for International Markets at Schneider Electric and I found it to be the most gratifying work I had ever done. To witness the energy transition of customers from Strategy to Execution to Reporting was a celebration of our work and what we could give back to Planet Earth. My love for Sustainability deepened even more after I attended TMI's first Masterclass a few years ago. It still brings back a lot of memories and a deep fondness for the core team at The Matcha Initiative, for what they do everyday. We need more of them!",
