    "Lead with purpose, scale with technology - 'Let your sustainability vision shape your technology decisions, not the other way around.' I highly encourage aligning business & digital transformation with sustainability goals. AI, IoT, and blockchain are powerful tools for transparency, efficiency, and decarbonization. But technology must serve a clear purpose, be it reducing emissions, optimizing resource usage or driving circular business models.",
    "Collaboration is the new innovation - 'Solve big problems together—don't reinvent the wheel when you can co-create it.' I strongly support cross-functional and cross-industry partnerships. From data-sharing platforms to ESG frameworks, collaborative ecosystems unlock faster and more resilient innovation. Impact can be amplified by joining forces with startups, academia, and even competitors.",
    "Measure what matters, govern, then act. - 'Sustainability without metrics is storytelling. With the right data, it's strategy.' I must stress the importance of an ESG governance board and data-driven decision-making. Encourage them to invest in ESG data platforms and real-time monitoring tools. I would also like to caution against analysis paralysis. Use the insights to take bold, iterative steps toward environmental and social impact."

  "sustainability_journey": "My journey into sustainability wasn't sparked in a boardroom or a business case — it began by a lake. I grew up near Sukhna Lake in northern India's Chandigarh, a man-made reservoir at the foothills of the Shivalik Hills. Every summer as water levels dropped and silt threatened to choke the lake, our school organized 'shramdan' or voluntary community service. Alongside classmates, teachers and locals, I'd wade into shallows, dig trenches, remove silt and clear debris under the blazing sun.",
