  "sustainability_journey": "I came into sustainability through a mix of curiosity, conviction, and a recognition of a real gap in the market. I noticed that many organisations were appointing a single sustainability manager and expecting them to drive massive, organisation-wide change — often without the resources, support, or engagement needed to succeed. What particularly struck me was how often the technical side of sustainability was covered, while the human side — the engagement, the culture shift, the storytelling — was missing.",

  "challenges_overcome": "Starting off alone and building my network was one of the biggest challenges. Like many founders, I had a clear vision but limited connections in the space when I began. It took time — and a lot of showing up — to find my people. I leaned into collaboration, attended events, volunteered, and reached out to others doing good work. Slowly, I built a strong network of like-minded professionals who are now collaborators, clients, and friends.",
