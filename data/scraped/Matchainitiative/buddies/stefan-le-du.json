  "introduction": "I'm a French sustainability changemaker based in Tokyo. After 15 years in public policy for the French government, I moved to Japan in 2016. Initially at the French Embassy, I then joined the private sector to accelerate corporate sustainability mindsets. In 2024, I launched Ichigo Bloom, a collective of freelance facilitators offering sustainability education in Japan.",

  "sustainability_journey": "My career started in public policy for urban development, where environmental considerations were present but not central. In the early 2010s, France merged its environmental, land-use, and energy ministries, opening doors to sustainability roles. My first true sustainability position focused on urban renewable energy, leveraging my experience in urban planning while venturing into a new domain. After this, I landed a role as sustainable development councilor at the French Embassy in Tokyo.",

  "japan_realization": "Living in Japan, I realized the country wasn't as 'green' as I initially thought. This, combined with the rising global focus on climate change following the adoption in 2025 of the Paris Agreement, awakened me to the urgency of sustainability. Things that I didn't use to think a lot about before 2015, like the CO2 impact of my flight from Paris to Tokyo, became a constant consideration. Over the past decade, sustainability has become the core focus of my work.",

  "challenges_overcome": "The language barrier can hinder Japanese organizations from connecting with global sustainability trends. Without translation into Japanese, many companies are unlikely to engage with these trends. When the TNFD released its framework to help businesses understand biodiversity risks in October last year, only two languages were available: English, for the whole world, and Japanese, for Japan. CDP also does extra efforts to translate all its documents and questionnaires to Japanese.",
  "language_barrier_solution": "While my Japanese language skills are still developing, I've learned to work effectively with others who have the expertise I lack. By combining my understanding of global sustainability trends and experience in Europe with the communication expertise of Japanese talent, we create a powerful team.
