  "introduction": "I am the founder and soap crafter at My Naked Bar. I founded the label to spark conversations around living a more intentional low-waste lifestyle through playful applications of our soap packaging that challenges the norm. Prior to this journey, I was in the healthcare/eyecare industry. Companies these days are increasingly looking to gift sustainably. However, a majority still view regular 'green' products as their choice sustainable gifts which lead to major over-production around the world. Hence, I am on a journey to advocate for what I call Impact Positive Gifting - the gifting of essentials that are consumables that can be used up while inspiring low-waste lifestyles.",
  "top_3_advice": ["Be critical of your sustainability efforts and their implications. Plastic was invented to save our planet, but it has unfortunately become a key evil behind our climate issues. Let's do what we can to critically assess our actions, so that we do not fall into the trap of creating more problems for our planet while trying to save it.", "Engage and rally your community. Awareness of climate issues is at all-time high, and yet most of us have not made any changes to our lifestyles. Go beyond awareness and explore ways to truly inspire the community, and continuously support them in sustaining lifestyle changes.", "Instil throughout organisational levels and departments a genuine understanding of waste reduction. Often, although organisations champion sustainability from the top, practical understanding and application of the mindset have not trickled down or across all departments."],
  "how_can_help": "I am happy to share my journey at My Naked Bar, the ethos that grounds us, and how we challenge the norms to start conversations and rally a community of contributors to broaden our impact. I would also love to provide different perspectives on true sustainable gifting, how to be more critical in gift selection to avoid creating more waste while trying to support sustainability.",
  "expertise_areas": ["Green office", "Circular Economy", "Waste Management", "Local Community Involvement - CSR - Philanthropy", "Responsible Marketing", "Sustainable HR Practices"],
  "sustainability_journey": "I've had a low-waste mindset from a young age and cannot part with items still in good condition, even packaging. A few years ago, when I read about how plastics take 500 years or more to break down, I was pulled into exploring the wider climate change issue which was, at the time, mostly discussed overseas. It was rarely talked about in Singapore, even in the media, and nobody around me cared. I recognised that to have a bigger impact, more people need to join the journey. And that's how I started My Naked Bar, my own label of handcrafted vegan soap bars.",
  "sustainable_actions": ["Rallying individuals and communities around Singapore to contribute used milk cartons", "Upcycling these milk cartons into primary, secondary and shipping packaging for soap bars", "Passing on excess milk carton caps to other organisations like Plastify, Playeum, 450.sg, The Sustainability Project", "Gathering plastic backing from stickers and mailer bags, passing them to Green Nudge for eco bricks", "Sharing low-waste lifestyles through social media"],
  "challenges_overcome": "Finding enough milk cartons for packaging was a challenge. We reached out to Package Pals, Journey to Zero Waste community, and people at pop-up events. We created content teaching proper carton cleaning and provide feedback to contributors. To minimise carbon impact, we request contributors to batch 20 cartons before collection and now have 3 drop-off points.",
  "most_proud_of": "I am proud of our little 'Ripple Tribe' - the community of contributors we've built up over the years, and how some organisations have accepted impact positive gifting, even using milk cartons, and presented to C-Suites on stage.",
  "business_concept": "My Naked Bar - handcrafted vegan soap bars in upcycled milk carton packaging",
