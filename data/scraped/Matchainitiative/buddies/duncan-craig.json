  "introduction": "Duncan, originally from the UK, has been based in Asia for the past 20 years. He is the Co-Founder and Design Director of reXtore, a Singapore-based circular design studio pioneering sustainable innovation in the events and exhibitions space. Duncan is also the creator of STAXX, a revolutionary modular building system made from 100% recycled ocean-bound plastic. Designed from scratch to solve the waste challenges of temporary structures, STAXX is now helping transform how brands and organisers build — block by block — with zero tools, minimal waste, and maximum creativity. With a background in interior architecture and project delivery across the retail, F&B, and commercial sectors throughout Asia Pacific, Duncan is passionate about rethinking how we design, build, and consume — through the lens of circularity, reusability, and impact reduction.",
  "top_3_advice": [
    "Start small - Just Do it! Circularity can feel overwhelming at first, but one step forward often leads to momentum—and eventually, transformation.",
    "Don't go it alone. The circular economy is built on collaboration. Reach out — this movement is full of passionate, helpful people.",
    "Keep your purpose close. When the journey gets tough (and it will), remind yourself why you started. That clarity will keep you going."
  ],
  "how_can_help": "I can share hands-on experience and proven practices from building modular, low-waste systems in one of Singapore's most waste-heavy industries—events and exhibitions. Whether you're starting your sustainability journey or scaling your circular approach, I'm happy to help you navigate the challenges and opportunities.",

  "sustainability_journey": "The construction and events industries are among the most wasteful — generating a staggering amount of landfill waste and emissions through short-term builds, temporary structures, and excessive use of raw materials. After years working in these sectors, the environmental cost became too heavy to ignore. Eventually, the guilt transformed into resolve. With my team at reXtore, we made it our mission to challenge the status quo — rethinking how things are built, displayed, and ultimately discarded. We began focusing on designing out waste, reducing reliance on virgin materials, and building systems that could be reconfigured, not replaced.",
  "challenges_overcome": "The biggest challenge has been disrupting an industry built on a linear model of 'build and bin.' Retail pop-ups, exhibitions, and temporary fit-outs are designed to be short-lived, with almost everything discarded after one use. We addressed this with reXtore, by creating modular, reusable systems for events and exhibitions. But we needed something even more flexible, scalable, and structurally sound. After searching globally and finding no truly circular modular system that met our needs, I decided to design one from scratch— and that's how STAXX was born. STAXX is a modular building system made from 100% recycled ocean-bound plastic.",
  "sustainable_actions": "I lead sustainability strategy and product development across reXtore and STAXX, where we've introduced: Modular systems for exhibitions and events that eliminate single-use builds; Circular design frameworks that embed reuse, repair, and adaptability into every solution; STAXX, our in-house modular innovation made from recycled ocean-bound plastic; Strategic partnerships with bodies like the Singapore Tourism Board and SACEOS to drive industry-wide adoption of low-waste, low-carbon practices; A commitment to replacing traditional throwaway builds with structures that evolve and endure.",
  "most_proud_of": "What started as frustration with the industry's waste has turned into something we're now deeply proud of. With reXtore, we've helped shift the mindset of the events sector—proving that sustainability and design excellence can go hand in hand. With STAXX, we've created something from the ground up that the industry didn't even know it needed. It's not just a product—it's a new way of thinking about how we build, adapt, and reuse. Knowing that STAXX is helping people create with ease, reduce impact, and reimagine what's possible— without tools, glue, or waste—makes all the challenges worth it.",
  "key_innovation": "STAXX - a revolutionary modular building system made from 100% recycled ocean-bound plastic, designed for zero tools, minimal waste, and maximum creativity",
  "philosophy": "Build Different - We're not here to add more stuff to the world. We're here to change how it's made."
