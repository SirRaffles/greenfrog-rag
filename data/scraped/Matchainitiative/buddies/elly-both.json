  "sustainability_journey": "After going back to work after my second child, I was working in the corporate world in a Project Director role and it felt like something was missing. It came to me that if I could run Change Management programs in one sector, I hoped I could do it to make an impact in my area of passion - Sustainability.",
  "sustainable_actions": "With my previous employer, I conceptualised the Employee Green team where we had 30 employees from across Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia working on various sustainability and social impact related initiatives. These included: writing a monthly newsletter to educate the broader business on the importance of taking sustainability seriously, removed single-use plastic from the kitchens, reduced printing/paper usage, organised a beach clean up, brought in guest speakers on various environmental-related topics, ran a collection of clothing and books to send to earthquake-affected areas in the Philippines, and many more.",
  "challenges_overcome": "There were a few challenges along the way such as budget, delays with internal approvals and others, but we managed to work closely with our Executive Sponsor, the head of business, to remove any roadblocks and move things ahead. Keeping in close contact with the teams to help them with any barriers was also very effective.",
