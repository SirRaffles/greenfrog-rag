  "introduction": "I grow the profitability of companies, leveraging data and sustainability. Harnessing 20+ years' experience, I've grown businesses ranging from local start-ups to $4b/100k-employee corporations. I've lived in USA, Australia, Singapore, China, Indonesia and worked with industries ranging from software to non-profit to consumer electronics. This diversity provides practical yet inspirational ideation to my work. As a systems-thinking expert, I drive sustainability improvements to help sales, product development, supply chain, compliance, and ultimately the bottom line.",

  "sustainability_journey": "Life dropped me into an inspirational, leading sustainability environment, and I wondered why. Evolving more sustainably in my personal life was inspirational and beautiful. However, bringing sustainability into my professional life became a journey of challenges. Where I found gaps in available information, I founded Sisloff International & The Eco-Marketing Project to share content and expertise in order to empower others globally.",

  ],
  "challenges_overcome": "I continue to be bemused by why sustainability isn't more embedded across companies, why data from sustainability reports isn't used more in making improvements, and ultimately why sustainability is often seen only as a cost-centre and not a system-wide opportunity to increase profits. To shift away from this mindset, I make it a point to identify areas of improvement in sustainability reports which, if acted on, not only make a company more sustainable but also improve operational efficiencies to minimise costs.",
