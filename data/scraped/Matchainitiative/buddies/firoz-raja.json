  "sustainability_journey": "Neste's vision of creating a healthier planet for our children excited me 6-7 years ago. Having lived in Singapore for more than a decade, I appreciate that we must all conserve and cherish what we are inheriting today, as none of it was easy to have in the past. Hence, I am committed to put the community, country and our Earth in a better state than what I found it in yesterday!",
  "sustainable_actions": "I serve as a primary consultant for developing impactful investment proposals. I am currently spearheading asset development strategies, crafting proposals to enhance business sustainability and growth for Neste's Singapore renewable fuel refineries. I also mentor junior engineers, conducting reviews, providing technical guidance, and fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement. Additionally, I have championed process improvements, streamlining operations and increasing productivity by 15%.",
  "challenges_overcome": "Even working with the world's largest renewable manufacturer, convincing internal stakeholders not to de-accelerate the mission to leave behind a healthier planet for our children can be quite challenging! A common challenge that I face is coming up with a compelling business case where stakeholders remain fully committed to either build a resilient refinery or make a change to continue producing more. Gathering factual data to sell a business case is never easy. However, I have realised that such data can often be found when talking to and engaging all your stakeholders. Hence, for me, in order to continue delivering what I enjoy, I have to keep engaging all my stakeholders (internal & external) effectively.",
