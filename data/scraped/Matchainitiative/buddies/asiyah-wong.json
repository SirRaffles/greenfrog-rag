    "sustainability_motivation": "I became interested in sustainability after watching videos on animals and how they are treated in the industrial modern food system - that is to say, very cruelly. That sparked my journey towards rethinking not just food and drink but also every little part of our daily life such as transport, circular economy, and food waste composting rather than incineration. I've led teams working on topics as diverse as plastic pollution in the Citarum in Java, Indonesia, to carbon divestment activism on university campuses building capacity based on successes in the US and Malaysia.",
