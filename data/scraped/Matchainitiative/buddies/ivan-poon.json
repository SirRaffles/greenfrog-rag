  "guidance_areas": ["Experience & Expertise Sharing"],
  "introduction": "I am passionate about various sustainability topics, including advancing the science and technology of solar energy and its integration into urban systems. With a PhD in Urban Planning from the National University of Singapore, I have developed a novel methodology to estimate the solar energy potential of a city, using remote sensing, GIS, and machine learning techniques. I have over 10 years of experience in the consultancy and research industries, working on various projects related to renewable energy systems, sustainability, and smart city solutions. I have also been a trainee at Idiap Research Institute since 2019, where I collaborate with leading experts in the field of artificial intelligence and data science.",
  "top_3_advice": ["Understand the topic you are interested in.", "Talk to more people.", "Enjoy the process."],
  "how_can_help": "My knowledge and connections are quite unique, which I believe make them useful tools for The Matcha Initiative website users. I just organized a climate change workshop at one of the largest AI conferences, as well as a successful networking event related to sustainability and AI.",
  "expertise_areas": ["Sustainable Buildings & Resilient Cities", "Carbon Management & Carbon Footprint", "Consultants"],
  "sustainability_journey": "I was drawn to sustainability as a concept at the intersection of science, technology, and real-world impact. Early on, I became interested in how urban systems can be designed to support clean energy transitions. That led me to pursue a PhD focused on estimating solar energy potential in cities using machine learning. Now, I am trying to connect the dots.",
  "sustainable_actions": "As an urban sustainability researcher and a core member of Climate Change AI (CCAI), I help organize discussion seminars featuring AI and sustainability research for a broader audience. My focus has been on connecting different sectors — academia, industry, and policy — to explore how emerging technologies can accelerate climate action and make a greater impact. I have also served as a mentor for a sustainability competition.",
  "challenges_overcome": "One of the main challenges I've encountered is aligning the diverse perspectives and priorities of various stakeholders. Overcoming this requires active listening, open communication, and creating shared platforms where collaboration can happen more effectively. Additionally, driving sustainability can be tough when people are fragmented. As such, I strive to connect talents for greater impact.",
  "most_proud_of": "What I'm most proud of is staying committed to this space over the years — combining research, real-world applications, and community building. I bring broad experience across sustainability topics, and remain eager to learn and contribute wherever I can.",
