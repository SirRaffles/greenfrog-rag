  "introduction": "I'm Lucie, mother of 2 Book lovers, 2 and 5 years old. I have 10+ years experience in Marketing, Digital and ecommerce in industries such as Skincare, Watches & Jewelry and Fashion; in international companies as well as start-ups. I am looking today to use my skills for projects that make sense, having social and/or environmental positive impacts. I'm convinced about sustainable ways of doing business and believe in the power of circular economy: many objects do not need to be owned but have their value in the usage we make of them. Following this conviction and a growing interest in Education, I founded my first start-up in Dubai in 2023, Sharingstories.me, a multicultural Kids Library delivered home.",
