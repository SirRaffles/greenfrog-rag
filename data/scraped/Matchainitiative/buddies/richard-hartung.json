  "sustainability_journey": "The importance of sustainability hit home when I saw air quality drop, glaciers disappear and previously-unimaginable heat waves. I got involved when I co-founded the Jane Goodall Institute in Singapore and served on the boards for over a decade and gradually started to do more. When the pandemic reduced my travel from over 30% to about zero, I decided to shift from my previous focus as a banker and banking consultant to sustainability, to play a part in solving the most important issue of our time. I've leveraged my experience with writing, training, finance and non-profits to lead or support sustainability initiatives.",
