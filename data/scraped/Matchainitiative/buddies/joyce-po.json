  "introduction": "Based in Singapore, I have been a marketing and advertising professional for over 20 years globally. In the last year, I have been more involved in sustainability, with the intention of using my expertise to help educate on, promote, and facilitate the adoption of sustainability to the wider public. I have also been helping ground-up organisations with branding and marketing efforts to raise capital, obtain grants, and benefit from crowd-sourcing.",
  "top_3_advice": ["Always follow the science. Ensure that your actions are grounded in scientific logic.", "Learn on the ground. In order to understand problems better, you really need to experience them firsthand, as well as talk to experts and work by their side.", "Sustainability is not easy, but what you really need to do is persevere with the right mindset and sincere intentions."],
  "how_can_help": "I would love to coach ground-ups on how to market and brand themselves better so as to get more support. I am also happy to share the best practices of those who are doing well, be it because of their ability to get support from investors, have significant participation from the general public, or expand their businesses or initiatives.",
  "expertise_areas": ["Waste Management", "Responsible Marketing", "Consultants"],
  "sustainability_journey": "I am generally curious about current affairs. Given that climate change is a key issue of today, I feel that the general public (myself included) is unfortunately too passive about it. It made me realise that doing nothing will not help. Additionally, having had opportunities to share my expertise to ground-ups doing noble work on sustainability inspired me to pursue this even further.",
  "sustainable_actions": "Personally, I have invested in waste management. As an organisation, we have been doing a lot of volunteer work to support ground-ups, taken training on circular economy collages, and gone on the ground to learn more about sustainability-focused companies and organisations. From a practical perspective, we make it a point to minimise waste and promote circularity where possible.",
  "challenges_overcome": "We continue to face problems in gaining support or proceeding with projects, mainly because sustainability is still not a priority in certain companies. In some ways, we try to encourage parties to understand sustainability better and also just keep trying to pitch our ideas.",
  "most_proud_of": "In the span of less than 2 years, we have been able to meet many people from different aspects of sustainability. We are continuously learning from them and have been infected by their passion to help make a difference.",
