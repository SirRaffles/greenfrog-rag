  "introduction": "I am the Executive Director for TerraCycle Foundation. We prevent, remove, and recycle ocean plastics through a variety of programs, including daily cleanup activities, workshops, educational outreach and recycling partnerships. I currently focus on projects in Thailand. Originally from Vancouver, Canada, I have an entrepreneurial background. I have launched several startups in the service, retail, advertising, and tech industries.",
  "top_advice": [
    "Learn to tell your story in an inspiring way, and then back it up with facts (quantify it). You may be super passionate and have the best program in the world but if you can't inspire people to support you, it will fail.",
    "Develop an entrepreneurial mindset. There will always be obstacles, and passion alone will not get you all the way to your destination. No or a failure is not the end, it's just a path not meant for you. There is always another way to solve the problem.",
    "Enjoy the journey, and recognize what you have already achieved. Sometimes the path is difficult, or you may feel unappreciated, or the cause is hopeless. It's important to celebrate your wins and turn your losses into lessons that motivate you to take on your next challenge.",
    "Measure your progress. It's easy to get caught up in the project, and get distracted or go off track. Measuring your impact can help you better understand what is or isn't working, and then address problems. It's also great for motivation and goals."

  "how_they_help": "I am great at helping people evaluate their vision and develop a practical action plan or steps to start working on. I won't do the work for them, but I will guide and mentor where I have experience, and introduce them to or teach them to find mentors in other areas outside my expertise. I also excel at brainstorming solutions to challenging problems. I prefer receiving questions by text/email, which I can respond to in my downtime. I can help with start-up challenges and business model evaluation. I am particularly good at solving operational problems like launching projects quickly, or turning failing projects around.",

  "sustainability_journey": "My passion for the ocean has always led me to projects related to ocean appreciation and conservation. Growing up in Vancouver allowed me to develop an appreciation for beautiful forests and clean waterways. This eventually led me to be a diver, aquarist, and for some time, even a coral farm owner. Unfortunately as time passed by, and I traveled around the world, I saw how plastics and pollution were damaging rivers and oceans everywhere I went. This led to me apply my business management skills to projects focused on sustainability.",
  "achievements": "I am most proud of the fact that we have been successfully reducing waste in Bangkok's canals, and that we've reached and impacted thousands of households along the canals by improving their environment. I'm also proud that we've educated thousands of schoolchildren to implement green school programs in their schools and communities, and that we have been a catalyst for many people and organizations to implement and expand their own sustainable initiatives.",
