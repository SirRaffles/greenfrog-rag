With ICT equipment, it often contains data so data sanitization services such as magnetic degaussing are value added services we provide when we help clients recycle e-waste. From Dec 2020 to June 2021, we have been instrumental in executing and promoting the PMD disposal and recycling program with the support of NEA and LTA.",
