  "top_3_advice": ["Bring methodology into your roadmap. It all comes back to your SMART objectives and the way you are going to report on them.", "Create a strong green team, with different profiles and people that are willing to drive the change internally.", "Ensure there is a strong buy in from the management. A very good way to do so is to make sure that the sustainability objectives are closely linked to your business ones."],

  "sustainability_journey": "In my previous role, I was actively involved in sustainability at the regional level. My financial director had a good grasp on sustainability and wanted to make change, but she could not do it alone. Along the journey of helping my director with sustainability transformation, I gained exposure to The Matcha Initiative, Climate Fresk workshops, and many other sustainability resources. Being involved in many sustainability efforts and discussions enlightened me on the importance of corporate involvement in the sustainability movement. This inspired me to learn more about change management, as well as write my Executive Masters thesis on sustainability.",
  "sustainable_actions": "I am in charge of regional sustainability strategy in my current role. The very first step is ensuring leaders such as managing directors are aware of the need for sustainability. We can then raise concern among suppliers, employees and customers. Next, audits on supplier management, employee engagement and waste management are done to set the basis for target-setting. For example, we do full life cycle assessments (LCA) and monitor CO2 emissions, among other efforts. Using the insights gained, we set specific sustainability targets to achieve. I am also part of The Matcha Initiative's Responsible Marketing online solutions working group.",
  "challenges_overcome": "Despite having a clear sustainability strategy, alignment of stakeholder interests was the first hurdle, especially when stakeholders prioritised business objectives over sustainability ones. I realised that our control is limited. For example, although we are heavily reliant on our suppliers and are therefore partially responsible for their environmental and social impacts, it is hard to impose our own views on them because they have their own. In such cases, what we can do is to continue raising awareness among stakeholders, and doing whatever is possible with the given resources and support to drive sustainability transformation.",
  "most_proud_of": "I am very proud of the Sustainable community we created in Asia with my colleague, Karine. This is a very unique set-up in a company as we had one or two ambassadors to lead the sustainability topics locally. They were fully empowered and involved many different roles into their initiatives, creating the right internal emulation. To me, the most important is to create those regular catchups during which you can share not only the status on projects but also ideas. Even what can be seen as small actions are source of inspiration for the whole community.",
