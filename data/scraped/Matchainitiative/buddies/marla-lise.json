    "introduction": "I endeavour to inspire others to venture outside the box and open their minds to the many exciting perspectives the world has to offer. I believe that education, soft skills, and language are essential to improve the state of the world and the people in it. As an educator, I cultivate education, environmental literacy and eco-habits through my work at The English Curve and The Eco Chapter, facilitate the Climate Fresk, Biodiversity Collage, Circular Economy, and Conscious Evolution collaborative learning games, and was a mentor and panelist for the 2023 WWF We Got This campaign. I also conduct my own writing workshops based on using eco-literacy and literature as a form of activism.",

    "sustainability_motivation": "I started harping on about saving the planet as young person, way before today's version of Sustainability existed. When I was little, I dreamt of saving animals and moving to Africa. I only made it to Africa in 2023 but seem to have spent my life searching for alternatives. I've lived in the South American jungle, dived in Asian tropical oceans, and even crewed on board a sailboat in Papua New Guinea, all in hopes of inspiring myself and others to look at the beautiful world we live in and all it has to offer. Travelling on my own at quite a young age and being raised as a citizen of the world, I have seen wonders that most can only imagine. This just fueled my passion to save our planet. I am still very much motivated to continue the war cry in order to mitigate climate change. A hopeless romantic, I am one who falls in love with stories and dreams, I imagine an idealistic dreamworld and hope to achieve it through education.",

    "actions_implemented": "In 2022, I rebranded my language company to include The Eco Chapter - The English Curve's environmentally conscious arm. Empowering change through environmental education. Here, I combine my backgrounds of conservation and education to raise awareness and hopefully create more eco-centric narratives. I have recently started a series of writing workshops where I hope to bring a community of #planetwriters together. I believe that words have the power to change. With the right skills and tools many people will be able to change the system with their words. A study by a researcher in the University of Pennsylvania found that we only need 25% of the population to adopt a behaviour for it to become commonly accepted. I am hoping that through education, collaborative learning, and writing, we are able to make mindful, sustainable living the norm.",
    "challenges_overcome": "Being a minority voice is difficult. In most situations, people want more, to go faster, to buy bigger, to be richer. In order to be sustainable, we are constantly swimming against the status quo. Every day is a challenge. I am not sure that I have overcome the challenges, but I am definitely motivated to keep fighting, and to motivate others to fight too.",
    "proudest_achievement": "I'm really proud of being adaptable and finding a way to survive wherever I am placed. I definitely think that travel has made me flexible. I hope to show others that plans usually don't go according to plan, and that's okay. Everything happens for a reason – just trust the process."
