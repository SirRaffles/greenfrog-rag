  "introduction": "Before joining Chanel, I was General Manager of BSI Singapore for 2.5 years. Prior to joining BSI, I held different job assignments for the international retailer Carrefour. For them, I oversaw Quality, Food Safety and Sustainability in China and then at the Group level. I spent most of my career working in Asia: in Shanghai, Hong Kong and I have been happily settled in Singapore for 8 years now. I have a real passion for sustainability and nature conservation and I love to share the knowledge and experience I gained in this field. I am also a volunteer for the Singaporean NGO called Climate Conversation which aims to raise awareness on climate change.",

  "bsi_mission": "BSI is the world's first national standards body, founded in London in 1901, and for those of you who are familiar with ISO - the International Organization for Standardization - BSI is proud to be a founding member of ISO, founded in London in 1946. Some of the world's most recognized business risk management standards, such as ISO 9001 for Quality Management, ISO 14001 for Environmental Risk Management and ISO 22301 for Business Continuity Risk Management and many more standards originate from BSI.",
  "bsi_sustainability_focus": "BSI is incorporated under Royal Charter, which means that unlike others who operate in our industry, we are completely independent from external influence, have no shareholders to answer to, and exist to support our clients in addressing current and future industry challenges. We enjoy a unique position, working with our clients, to help them accelerate their own contribution to the UN SDGs, offering assurance, regulatory and consulting services.",
  "team_sustainability_initiatives": "The persons in charge of our services related to sustainability (like environmental audits or social compliance audits) were, but the rest of the team was not, at the beginning. I raised awareness through several initiatives over time. It could be an expert from Climate Conversations - a local organisation that brings climate change conversations on the table - giving a talk in our office, or a BSI colleague from the US dropping by on his way to an audit in Johor, to host a short training. Or taking every opportunity such as World Water Day and International Women's Day, to spread information.",
  "daily_actions": "Among the most significant things, we hired interns to specifically take care of sustainability actions. One of their missions is to measure and reduce the company's carbon footprint. We took baby steps, like replacing plastic bottles with water dispensers, removing single-use plastic items in the pantry, replacing individual bins with recycling bins and providing clear instructions, organising an e-waste collection... Then building on those new habits, we rewarded monthly challenges with vouchers at 'green' shops, organised beach cleanups, created a Sustainability Pledge Calendar.",
  "proudest_achievement": "The change of mindset of my team's members. First they were barely aware of the issue and now sustainability is so integrated in their everyday life that, as I said, we can discuss it on WhatsApp after office hours! Sharing tips, asking questions, tracking progress, it also creates bonding. On top of that, it allows them to link their own personal experience with their work at BSI, with the company's purpose. It creates more value for all of us.",
