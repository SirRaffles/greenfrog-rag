  "introduction": "On a mission to create positive impact in the world, I consider myself an accidental entrepreneur. I discovered this during the 2009 economic crisis and in 2010, embarked on my first people, planet, profit venture; at the time challenging the negative perception of plant-based diets; enabling reduced-carbon and responsible consumption through a (then) pioneering circularity, systems-thinking, and purpose-led business. In 2015, relocating to Singapore with a more intentional move back to my innovation roots, I found few to no organisations combining both sustainability and innovation. It was this that seeded my vision for The Inceptery.",
  "top_3_advice": ["Start small but just start - strive for progress, not perfection.", "Aside from the financial metrics of your business, think of sustainability or ESG as representing the integrated health of your business. That in itself should tell you how it can help you through tough times.", "For every complex problem there is a solution which is clear, simple and wrong. Not everything is arduous and complex, but people often don't want to dedicate enough effort to the foundations. It pays off! I would encourage people to spend time to understand basic principles well and look for tensions, then apply this knowledge to their context. Don't simply copy + paste."],
  "how_can_help": "I am happy to support organisations in understanding, integrating and managing evolving sustainability requirements that are now a mainstay of any contemporary corporate strategy. Having started two sustainability-driven businesses (one 2x B Corp certified), I also have over twenty years of experience across various industries with proven capability to navigate complex environments effectively, functioning as practitioner/consultant while overseeing people and processes simultaneously.",
  "expertise_areas": ["Circular Economy", "Corporate Governance, Mission & Strategy", "Responsible Marketing", "Consultants", "Sustainable Supply Chain & Logistic"],
  "sustainability_journey": "Having worked to create value and address challenges in the corporate world, I had a feeling that I could make a positive contribution to the world through my work. Initially, I had no idea where to start, so I took a permaculture design course - which taught everything from self-sufficiency and resilience to systems thinking, followed by other learning experiences around sustainability. Following that, I applied what I had learned to cofounding a sustainability-led, regenerative, circular, and plant-based venture back in 2010. When I moved to Singapore, I combined my past experience in design and innovation with sustainability, but focused on supporting others this time.",
  "sustainable_actions": "The Inceptery has a unique network-based business model. We are women-owners, so our core team is very small. After spending a number of years attempting, we became B Corp certified (with the broader community's help the first time). Visioned, positioned, created and brought two sustainability-led ventures to life; Worked with non-profits and for-profits to find ways to bring sustainability-led innovation and responsible business practices; Facilitated workshops on sustainability-led innovation by lead groups to create unique business models as part of global innovation challenges; Contributed time and effort to support those interested in starting this journey.",
  "challenges_overcome": "Gaining widespread, true acceptance is still a challenge. No matter how much people talk about it, many organisations are still unable or reluctant to invest in sustainability as a business driver, because they do not see it as a competitive advantage or value creator. I am not sure that we have overcome this yet, but many of us are working on it!",
  "most_proud_of": "Starting as early as I possibly could (even being one of the early TMI Buddies!). At the Inceptery, we feel that we are some of the pioneers of the new systems. We focus on sustainability as something creating systemic value, not simply as a risk management or compliance need. As a boutique collaborative-consultancy, we have a different model which is asset-light and built on partnerships to adapt (scale or shrink). Also proud of our dedication to try to walk the talk ourselves - using business as a force for good.",
