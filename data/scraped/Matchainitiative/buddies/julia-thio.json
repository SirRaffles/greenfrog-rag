  "introduction": "I hold a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Geography from Universitas Gadjah Mada. During my college years, I was interested in urban studies (infrastructure, urban planning, and public transportation). I believed that businesses always harmed the environment and believed in the power of research. Yet, I was not satisfied with the impact it had. It was then that I began to think about how to 'change' the business system: profitably, benefitting the communities, preventing damage to the environment, and restoring it. 'Sustainability in business' became my cause.",

  "sustainability_journey": "Growing up, my family and I always relied on a car for transportation, enjoying its comfortable seats and clean interior, shielded from the blazing sun and rain. However, during my high school years, I made the decision to take public transport home. On one particularly hot and humid day in Jakarta, where even the slightest breeze was absent, I found myself emotionally affected by the weather. Walking along the street, I walked to hide in the shade of trees, escaping the harsh sun. At that moment, as the wind gently blew, I felt a sense of peace and happy! What motivates me to do sustainability is really quite simple. However, the experience still resonates in my mind, serving as the driving force behind my desire to continue learning and assisting others in embracing sustainability.",

  "challenges_overcome": "It is quite challenging to implement sustainability practices throughout the business operations. However, I always come across stories/news that discuss the positive growth of sustainability practices in businesses. It gives me hope once again. And of course, being part of a community that shares the same concern and passion for sustainability.",
