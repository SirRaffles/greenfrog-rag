    "introduction": "Raised in the Middle East by Eastern European parents, I was surrounded by layers of diversity. Extensive traveling throughout my childhood stimulated a fascination for cultures, languages and geopolitics, and I continued living a pseudo-nomadic life as an adult. While I began my career on the trading floor in NYC, I later worked in Africa, Asia, Europe and South America in diverse roles (investments, micro-finance, communications, and business development). Fluent in five languages, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and later completed a Masters in International Affairs from Fletcher (Tufts), and have a number of Sustainability related certificates.",

    "sustainability_motivation": "Growing up my parents exposed me to the concept of sustainability before it was coined as such. Exposed to the world and its injustices, but more importantly, its potential, I purposefully looked for ways in which I could make an impact, both professionally and personally. I have worked \"on the field\" for multi-lateral organisations and NGOs as well as for large private-sector financial and consulting groups: learning to \"see\" sustainability from both perspectives has been powerful in creating unity, partnerships and action oriented programs.",
