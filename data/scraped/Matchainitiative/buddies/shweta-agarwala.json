  "sustainability_journey": "I had a growing sense of responsibility, both personal and professional to kickstart my sustainability journey. As an engineer and materials scientist, I was trained to innovate, to create, and to push the boundaries of technology. But over time, I started asking: What are the long-term consequences of these innovations? What happens to the materials we use once products are discarded? How do we design for the planet, not just for performance?",

  "electronics_urgency": "Working in electronics made this even more urgent as it is a major contributor to waste and environmental degradation. I saw a clear need to rethink how we design materials, devices, and systems from the ground up.",
  "foundational_belief": "That realization became the foundation of my work: integrating sustainability into tech development, launching ventures like Thrivescape and Bitsem, and helping others rethink their sustainability journeys. I'm here because I believe sustainability isn't a side project but a design principle, a mindset, and a shared responsibility. And the time to act is now.",
