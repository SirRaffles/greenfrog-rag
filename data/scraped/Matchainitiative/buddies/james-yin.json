  "top_3_advice": ["Be hungry to learn. New policies, standards, and regulations are being rolled out regularly. It takes effort to understand new innovations and business concepts that can address climate change as well. You need to keep learning in order to be ready and competent to contribute to climate action.", "Network extensively. Climate action is about transforming a broken global system. It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle that takes networking to understand how things work. Eventually, somebody out there will have the answer you are looking for.", "Persistence and resilience matter. Climate action is not for the faint-hearted. It's a marathon, not a sprint with quick results."],

  "sustainability_journey": "From soldier to sustainability champion ☘️: 3 years ago, I made a bold career move. After serving my country in a career as a military officer, I traded my green uniform for a greener mission: building a more sustainable future. Farming or entrepreneurship were never my aspirations. However, inspired by Bob Buford's 'Half-Time', I simply wanted the second half of my career to be impactful, just like the first. Re-visiting my Ikigai, I figured that my focus would be sustainability! This is because the biggest need for the next few decades is saving the 🌎 from ourselves.",
  "sustainable_actions": "As a company on a sustainability mission, I personally take charge of all aspects of sustainability.
