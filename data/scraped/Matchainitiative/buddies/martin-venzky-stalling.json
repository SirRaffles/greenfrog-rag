  "introduction": "Hi! I am from Germany, and am married with two grown-up boys. I live in Thailand and work across the region on innovation, sustainability and corporate development. Additionally, I provide strategy, policy, and training support. I am a licensed facilitator in different activities and tools' usage. Having lived in Asia for most of my adult life, I organised TEDxChiangMai and chaired the Sustainable Development Committee of the JFCCT (Joint Foreign Chambers of Commerce in Thailand).",

  "sustainability_journey": "My sustainability journey started in a very personal way. Living in Asia for many years, I experienced the serious impact of air pollution, especially during burning seasons in Northern Thailand. Seeing loved ones suffer from respiratory issues made it clear how real and immediate the problem was. At the same time, through my work with TEDxChiangMai, I had the chance to work with inspiring speakers focusing on climate change, sustainable cities, and community resilience. Over time, I became more involved with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and with corporate, multilateral inclusive business studies (GIZ), Bio-circular Green Economy (BCG), Digital Marketing for Green SMEs (ADB) and other projects such as smart and creative cities.",
  "sustainable_actions": "I provide advice on ESG and SDGs' impacts, as well as sustainability practices, knowledge, and mindsets. Additionally, I use interactive tools like the SDGs Game and Unbox the Box to help people explore complex systems and see their role in creating change for sustainability. These tools, along with workshops and training, make sustainability more accessible and practical.",
  "challenges_overcome": "One of the biggest challenges is shifting mindsets — helping people see sustainability not as a burden but an opportunity. To tackle this, I try to make sustainability practical and engaging: through workshops, coaching, hands-on exercises, and tools like the SDGs Game and Unbox the Box. These help people experience complexity and understand how their actions contribute to bigger outcomes. I also like to highlight real-world examples from the region to show that progress is possible.",
  "most_proud_of": "I am most proud of connecting people and projects to increase impact, as well as the impact of TEDx and my training programs. Since systems thinking is central to how I work, I enjoy connecting people and helping their ideas and strengths come together for greater impact. Through TEDxChiangMai, for example, I've seen how sharing ideas can lead to action far beyond the event itself.",
