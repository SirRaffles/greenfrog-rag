  "introduction": "As a sustainability communicator and content writer, I believe in the power of words to drive real change. With my background in corporate operations, I understand how to optimize from the inside out. Since pivoting to sustainability, I've become versed in ESG standards such as the PRCA and GRI to cut through greenwashing and foster transparency. Now I apply my technical knowledge and passion for authentic messaging to help companies communicate their sustainability efforts in a strategic, materiality-focused way, both internally and externally. I help organizations to begin their sustainability transition and communicate this to their various stakeholders. I aim to prove that incremental changes, paired with purposeful communications, can transform businesses and communities.",

  "sustainability_journey": "Throughout my corporate career, I immersed myself in writing various documents and honed my skills in content writing during the pandemic. However, I grew disillusioned with the false messaging and a sales-oriented approach to writing. Seeking a more conscious approach, I embarked on a sustainability journey. By chance, I attended a masterclass by the Matcha Initiative, which propelled me to delve deeper into sustainability issues. Witnessing the alarming state of the environment, exploitation of workers and the urgent need for change, I became determined to take action. My pursuit of better sustainability communication has become my mission. I use writing to raise awareness and inspire action. I aim to challenge false narratives and encourage conscious consumption, environmental stewardship, and social responsibility.",
