At the same time, I felt that my professional career needed a deeper purpose. I started my journey with the Climate Fresk, first as a participant. It was here that I realised I had my own role to play: spreading the word, educating, harnessing collective intelligence, encouraging people to focus on solutions. So I became a Climate Fresk facilitator.",
