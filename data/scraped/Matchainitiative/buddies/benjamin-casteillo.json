    "introduction": "I am an expert in Global Sustainability. I have quit a successful corporate career to dedicate my life to addressing our era's increasingly pressing sustainability challenges.

    "sustainability_motivation": "A long process of realizations that started in my childhood with a gut feeling that our world is not the way it should be. It was followed as a teenager with a feeling that we are heading toward our self termination. During my corporate career, the link between the addiction to profits and growth and the ecological crisis that we are facing became increasingly clear. The cognitive dissonance grew and I decided to quit my career in 2017 to focus on identifying and addressing the roots of the problem.",
    "organizational_responsibilities": "As a transdisciplinary research and education project, we do our best to integrate and embody the sustainable behavior change that we promote.",
    "challenges_and_solutions": "The biggest challenges I am facing right now are denial mechanisms, fear of change and apathy. The behavior crisis underlying the sustainability challenges of the 21st century is too often ignored. My strategy to overcome these challenges it to be fully honest with myself and accepting reality as it is. It is also to develop my mental and emotional intelligence, to be adaptable and resilient. I also learned not to be afraid to speak openly about the elephant in the room, and to be comfortable with disconfort.",
    "proudest_achievement": "My biggest pride is to having developed a unique and fundamental set of knowledge on the field of sustainability, notably about the roots of the Metacrisis and how they can be addressed.",
