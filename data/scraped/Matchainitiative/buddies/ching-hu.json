      "Never give up. Sometimes it can be depressing to read about the potential impact of climate change. Sometimes we question if the things which we do can make a difference to help solve the climate challenge. But never give up, for every little bit matters and great oaks grow from little acorns.",
      "Just get started. Many newcomers to the field of sustainability can find it daunting, given the technical jargons and complex frameworks. It will get easier over time, so just get started. There are plenty of resources and mentors to guide you on your journey.",

This is so critical to ensure that the world stays on track with the Paris Agreement outcomes to avoid dangerous climate change. While headquartered in Singapore, Terrascope's ambition is global and its work drives positive impact across large enterprises around the world.",
    "challenges_and_solutions": "The field of sustainability – and especially the carbon sector – is broad and dynamic. Regulatory developments and carbon disclosure standards are changing rapidly and getting more complex, and people are struggling to keep up. My team and I kept abreast of latest developments and continually improved our end-to-end decarbonisation platform product to stay relevant.",
    "proudest_achievement": "More than a decade ago, as a 17-year-old student, I rallied my friends to give free educational talks to raise awareness of climate change to more than 25,000 youths across 40 schools in Singapore. Our audience told us that they were inspired to incorporate green habits in their lives after listening to us, so I consider this to be a good first step on my life-long journey to make a green impact.",
