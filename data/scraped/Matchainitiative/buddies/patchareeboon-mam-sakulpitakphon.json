  "sustainability_journey": "With my human rights and international development background, I had incredible opportunities to work on several public-private sector partnerships with great success and impact. Thus, I wanted to continue and leverage the private sectors' ability to create positive impact to society and environment through corporate sustainability.",
  "current_role": "I am the Sustainability and Impact Lead for PALO IT Thailand. We are in the process of obtaining a B Corp certification and integrating sustainable IT into our practice. B Corp certification involves a thorough evaluation of how a company's practices impact its workers, community, environment, and customer and it requires detailed reporting on various aspects like carbon footprint, governance, diversity, employee benefits, data handling, and supply chain practices.",

  "challenges_overcome": "Working in 'sustainability' and/or 'development' can seem overwhelming and there's a never ending list of challenges. I recognize now through the years that the key is on building your own resilience and well-being too. It's important to stay focus, practical, and maintain our optimism in order to continue. Giving up doesn't help anything.",
  "proudest_achievement": "There are many 'most proud of' moments but it's really generating positive impact for people, society, and the world through my career in different ways.",
