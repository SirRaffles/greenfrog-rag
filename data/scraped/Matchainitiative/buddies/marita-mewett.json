  "sustainability_journey": "I delved into the world of sustainability driven by my experiences collaborating with diverse cultures. Working with individuals from various backgrounds underscored the importance of embracing a multitude of perspectives in constructing sustainable teams. I witnessed firsthand how the fusion of different ideas, values and approaches leads to more robust solutions that consider a broader spectrum of challenges. I am convinced that fostering a collaborative environment that seeks different viewpoints is fundamental to building resilient and sustainable initiatives. The notion that reducing our carbon footprint is a collective responsibility resonated with me.",
  "sustainable_actions": "My initial focus at NettZero was to release our first ESG report. During that process I realised that many organisations don't have the experience internally to produce an impactful report that is measurable year on year. In our first report we were acknowledged the efforts which lead to NettZero obtaining Climate Active Carbon Neutral Certification. A great achievement (which we can help others with), but continuous improvement in all three pillars of ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) is where the cross-team collaboration and innovative ideas comes in. I now help other organisations with building their ESG reports and planning measurable aspirations to work towards.",
  "challenges_overcome": "Data is always a challenge when it comes to accurate, relevant and measurable reporting. Getting a baseline for key data, such as emissions, diversity, training is critical. You can't manage what you don't measure. Not knowing where to start or feeling that everything has to be perfect often stops people from starting the journey. Don't let reasons like these stop you.",
