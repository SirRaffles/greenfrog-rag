  "sustainability_journey": "I grew up in Jakarta, where pollution and congestion were daily realities. After working as a mechanical engineer at Tesla and Hyperloop, I returned to Southeast Asia during the pandemic and saw how broken last-mile delivery was — costly, unsustainable, and dominated by gas-powered fleets. I realized that to drive systemic change, we needed to reimagine logistics from the ground up — powered by EVs, driven by software, and made accessible to gig workers. That's why I founded Blitz: to decarbonize urban mobility while empowering frontline workers. Sustainability isn't just a goal for me — it's a lens through which I build businesses.",

  "sustainable_actions": "I led the development of Blitz's EV-first logistics platform that now enables more than 500,000 monthly deliveries using zero-emission vehicles. We've built Southeast Asia's first distributed charging network for 2-wheel EVs, deployed over 4,000 electric bikes, and created a Mobile Selling model that reduces food waste and brings micro-entrepreneurs directly to customers. We've also digitized delivery performance to reduce idle time, optimize energy use, and lower per order emissions.",
