  "sustainability_journey": "Since moving to Singapore in 2018, I've been dedicated to raising awareness about sustainability by making small, conscious changes in my own life and sharing my journey with others. In 2019, I officially embarked on my green journey, taking action to inspire more people to do the same. From organising free workshops at home and leading sustainability talks to creating a neighbourhood community to reduce waste and encourage sharing with my neighbours, I've been committed to driving change from the ground up.",
  "achievements": "I am a proud multi-passionate entrepreneur, working on projects that are aligned with my values. I am proud to have started a business that is aligned with my values to keep on inspiring people to adopt greener steps by planting seeds in their heads and helping them grow in their journeys. At the end of the day, it's not about convincing people, it's about making them think. That's why I use a positive approach in my sustainability talks to share knowledge, open the minds and make them commit to starting with one action.",
