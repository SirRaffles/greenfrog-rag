  "sustainability_journey": "Being passionate about sustainability on a personal level for many years, I noticed that the sustainability movement in Singapore is still far from hitting the critical masses. While we are all aware of climate change and have good intentions to do our part, our everyday choices and actions are unfortunately not reflecting this. There is a real intention-action gap in our community, noticeable in poor recycling rates and low consumer demand for sustainable products and services. This gap is particularly wide among Gen Z, even though they are often lauded as the most environmentally conscious generation. Drawing from our corporate experience in Learning & Development and Finance, my co-founder and I came up with susGain in 2020 as a way to play our part in driving the change.",
  "achievements": "Being in a position to help drive the change towards a more sustainable Singapore and all of the wonderful people and organisations I get to work with on this journey.",
  "company_focus": "susGain runs customized sustainability challenges for corporates (which can be conducted both from home and/or office) that promote and encourage sustainability among employees through behavioural change in a fun and rewarding way while providing you with ESG reportable data on the impact created. Our work at susGain is focused on helping organisations cascade their strategic direction for sustainability down to their employees by educating them ways to act in their personal and professional capacities, with the goal to create long lasting culture change from inside out.",
