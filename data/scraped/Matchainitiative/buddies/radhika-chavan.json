  "sustainability_journey": "The process was very organic for me. With my vocational training as a chemical engineer, I had my first brush with environmental pollution control through assignments on Renewable energy sources. Two decades back, the technological advances were such that very small fraction of these initiatives were profitable. In my last 18 years of professional experience into IT-digital, I gained my technical skills, by working on feasibility studies, proof of concepts, financial forecasting, resource allocation, AI/ML and Web 3.0 development.",
  "turning_point": "But one that definitely brought my vocation and passion together was in 2019, when I was working on a concept note for Innovation Challenge Fund. The concept was to generate ESG Metrics for MSMEs to quantify net positive impact. This work gave me the opportunity to leverage tech in sustainability to understand and analyse operational efficiency and profitability. This paved my way to delve deeper into the subject of sustainability management accounting.",

  ],
  "sme_challenges": "SMEs play a very important role in the transition to a sustainable economy and their collective sustainability impact is significant. I am convinced that sustainability will affect SMEs' ability to create value over time and we want to help them to prepare for the new normal with less resources, more uncertainty, stricter regulations and demand for ESG data.",

  "proudest_achievement": "I am very proud of the journey that I have travelled so far. All the education, experience and passions I have gained along the way have empowered me to become the medium to build for a sustainable future, in my own small way. This answer may be a bit philosophical than what may have been expected. I am most proud to have come this far donning various hats to build various tools, products and processes which in turn helped me build high performing teams and organisations. And now, I am in the process of enabling SMEs to achieve the same outcomes through Tulyā. The only thing that is constant all along is my penchant for learning, and would love to continue to be on this path to create a sustainable future for my daughters.",
