  "introduction": "Most of my professional career was in Sales and Marketing for emissions-intensive sectors (automotive, telecom, oil and gas industries) to say the least….

  "sustainability_journey": "Back into my 20's, my diploma thesis was 'how to Market Fairtrade'; at that time, I was already concerned about bringing more equity and sustainability to businesses that were doing the right things. Soon after, I joined a small enterprise in the UK, collecting leather waste from the automotive, furniture and shoe industry that had no value for those manufacturers, but a real one for other players, who were giving scrap a second life. We were not yet talking about circular economy or cradle to cradle at the time, but this was creating value, and decreasing waste. While in Malaysia, I helped to grow a marketplace for discarded IT equipment that were still of use in developing countries. These experiences have forged my belief that we can reverse Climate change but we must all act collectively NOW.",
