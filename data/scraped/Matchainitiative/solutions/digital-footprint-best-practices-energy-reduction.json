  "description": "Solutions to reduce digital energy consumption and implement sustainable IT practices",
  "overview": "According to the revised Lean ICT Report the Digital energy consumption has increased by 6.5% yearly since 2015. \"Digital\" includes Internet, all our digital devices and the infrastructures needed to support them. Converted in GHG emissions, given the worldwide electricity mix, this represents around 3.5% of global GHG Emissions. It is already at the level of the airline industry. And the trend is worrying with a projection to double by 2025. \"Digital footprint\" comprises several energy consuming focuses: Production of devices, Usage of devices (Electricity consumption for batteries and data consumption relying on electricity consumption too), and Destruction of obsolete devices. All of them are at the core of green ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) thoughts to decrease our carbon footprint.",

And luckily, it can be applied to digital usage: prevent depletion of raw material, hazardous e-waste, rebound effects and to make our existing equipments last longer... Restraining our use of digital devices and technology whenever possible is key, yet very hard given our current world.",

        "Frequently clean your email box(es)",

        "Do not send heavy files, compress them or use online tools instead (like WeTransfer) to upload / share. WeTransfer automatically deletes files after 2 weeks",
        "Use tools such as Google Drive File Stream which only sync on your computer the files you work with. It massively reduces the volume of data exchange",
        "Send your emails to relevant persons only",
        "Remove logos and high resolution design components in your signature for internal usage",

        "Clear your cloud stored data (images, videos, heavy files...). Keep only what is useful",
        "Only use cloud infrastructures when necessary, to prevent irrelevant data exchange. Store locally as much as possible (internal disk / portable external disk / USB keys)",
        "Adopt green browsing habits: limit and optimize your search time spent on internet by registering frequent websites as \"favorite\", decreasing use of streaming....",
        "Remove non used softwares to decrease license costs and increase equipments lifetime. Use a computer cleaner (like macclean)",
        "Use Wifi instead of mobile data (4G) as often as possible (4G uses on average 4 to 8 times more energy than Wifi)",
        "Reduce Videos usage to Wifi and disable autoplay",
        "refrain from sending unnecessary videos & photos by email or social media",
        "Set Podcast and Videos resolution to minimum quality",
        "Do not always update minor softwares",
        "Prefer modular solutions that allows users to choose specific targeted, useful stacks instead of vast softwares people will use not entirely. Frugality is crucial."

Isit Academy estimates that: 15% of data received/sent by datacentres are processed from end-users, 15% of data received/sent by datacentres are processed from external datacentres, Remaining 70% (!) data are internal flows (save, security, storage...). This gives perspective to know where improvements should be made in priority. Especially, security processes are considered being the most energy consuming services in a datacentre."

I come from an IT & software agency background, so deeply into B2B and old-fashioned processes. I came to realize that sustainability cannot be only about consumers and half-hearted measures. I also realized IT sustainability was highly underrated and not understood by most companies. It came as quite a surprise for me, since I always considered IT sustainability to be one of the best ways to merge both ROI & sustainability to make the latter sound acceptable, actionable, and realistic. Having seen that, I wanted to make a change in my own way. My dedication came from the desire to be able to look my future kids in the eye and tell them that I tried to make the world a better place.
