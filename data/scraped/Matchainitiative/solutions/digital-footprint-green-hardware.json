  "overview": "22 kg of chemicals, 240 kg of fossil fuels and 1,5 T of clear water are necessary to produce a desktop computer and its screen according to UNU researchers. Combined with the very short lifespan of our digital equipments, this drastically raises their lifetime environment-related energy impacts. Digital products also contain significant quantities of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium and chromium, which pose potential health risks to production workers, recyclers and environmental risks to water supplies near landfills where they are eventually dumped. As a result, always remember that talking about hardware footprint involves two major energy-consuming cycles: Production of devices (material extraction, distribution) and Destruction of obsolete devices. Reducing our digital hardwares, Repairing, Re-using and Recycling them are the key steps to follow.",

If there isn't an explicit statement from a given company about how they use renewable or sustainable power, it's safest to assume the company is using a power from a mix of sources.
