  "overview": "Existing software engineering models do not pay much attention to green computing that focuses on the effective use of natural resources. However, making information systems greener is possible through different steps of projects: design, development per se, installation phase... On top of that, more and more models are being discussed and tested: green holistic methodologies, emergence of EI (environmental informatics) or Science Based Targets (SBT) methodology. Even if some models are being thought out, it is quite hard to enforce global green methodologies because there is no silver bullet yet. Before implementing any further big holistic methodologies, the section here should help you deploy quick-wins.",

I come from an IT & software agency background, so deeply into B2B and old-fashioned processes. I came to realize that sustainability cannot be only about consumers and half-hearted measures. I also realized IT sustainability was highly underrated and not understood by most companies. It came as quite a surprise for me, since I always considered IT sustainability to be one of the best ways to merge both ROI & sustainability to make the latter sound acceptable, actionable, and realistic. Having seen that, I wanted to make a change in my own way. My dedication came from the desire to be able to look my future kids in the eye and tell them that I tried to make the world a better place. I co-founded The Transmutation Principle, a Singapore-based consultancy, to support businesses in their quest for impact through actionable and tailor-made sustainability & ESG programs.",
