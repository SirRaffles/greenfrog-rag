Right now, I am the CEO of The Transmutation Principle.\n\nI come from an IT & software agency background, so deeply into B2B and old-fashioned processes. I came to realize that sustainability cannot be only about consumers and half-hearted measures. I also realized IT sustainability was highly underrated and not understood by most companies. It came as quite a surprise for me, since I always considered IT sustainability to be one of the best ways to merge both ROI & sustainability to make the latter sound acceptable, actionable, and realistic. Having seen that, I wanted to make a change in my own way.\n\nMy dedication came from the desire to be able to look my future kids in the eye and tell them that I tried to make the world a better place.\n\nI co-founded The Transmutation Principle, a Singapore-based consultancy, to support businesses in their quest for impact through actionable and tailor-made sustainability & ESG programs.\n\n‍ [thetransmutationprinciple](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thetransmutationprinciple/?originalSubdomain=sg)\n\n[Read More](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/buddies/thibaut-meurgue)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ec1fa9d6f5811ed09b4b2df/646bc3c411171f4be566be6d_photo%20Mimi%20cadree.jpg)\n\nMimi Nguyen\n\nGeneral Manager - Handprint -- Founding Member - The Matcha Initiative\n\nI was born in Vietnam and grew up in France in Paris’ low income suburbs. My parents used to bring us to the park to have some outdoor activities and that’s where my father taught my siblings and I to observe, love and respect nature. He gave us perspective on our place in a much bigger ecosystem.\n\nAt that time, we didn’t describe our family as “sustainable”. It was very pragmatic, we didn’t waste anything, we mended everything, saved and reused, because we just couldn’t afford not to :)\n\nIn 2018 in Singapore, after what felt like a long, unfulfilling professional tunnel on autopilot, I was forced to make a pause and took the opportunity to consider what I really wanted to do with my life (I know this resonates with many!)\n\nThen I really realised how passionate I was about sustainability and for the first time, I considered making it my job. Nothing is easy when you don’t hold the right degrees or the right amount of money, so I co-created The Matcha Initiative to jump into action instead of procrastinating. That’s how you start an amazing experience with amazing people :)\n\nCherry on the cake: TMI helped me land my current job at Handprint, where we help businesses embrace the next step - Regeneration.\n\n[handprint.tech](https://handprint.tech/)\n\n[Read More](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/buddies/mimi-nguyen)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ec1fa9d6f5811ed09b4b2df/5f4470788514a317c4c03a1b_Ivona.png)\n\nIvona Balint-Kowalczyk\n\nSustainability consultant, Founder - Sustainao\n\nI am the founder of Sustainao, a sustainability consulting firm based in Singapore.
