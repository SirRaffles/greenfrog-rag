    "overview": "Waste in the dining area is something we have all experienced, whether it is the edible food we throw in the bin or the plastic packaging used and thrown away everyday. Only 19% of Food Waste is recycled in Singapore. Taking actions, to reduce our food waste and to better recycle it, can therefore have a positive impact. Moreover, as food waste is visible, it can be a good area for team building and sustainability awareness and trainings.",
