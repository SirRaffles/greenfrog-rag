First, you need to start analysing your current carbon footprint and to define how to report it in order to properly measure and communicate progress.\n\nThis step will be the foundation of your carbon management journey.\n\nAccuracy is not the primary goal here: future improvements in measurement can be part of your action plan. It is advisable to have a broad overview of the GHG emissions generated by your activities: this will increase the potential for future reductions.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e940b86961046721a7e92b5/5f1a5ac944901e478b33c069_Down%20arrow%20.png)\n\nCOST\n\nEFFORT\n\nIMPACT\n\n[Reset All](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/find-a-solution/carbon-management-and-carbon-footprint-measure-and-report#)\n\nThank you!

It is useful to use Scopes 1, 2 and 3 as defined by the [Greenhouse Gas Protocol](https://ghgprotocol.org/), the most widely used greenhouse gas accounting standard in the world:\n\n\\- **Scope 1 emissions** are the direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by your company, such as company vehicles, your factories or buildings burning fuel.\n\n\\- **Scope 2 emissions** are the indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heat and cooling consumed in facilities or operations owned or controlled by your company.\n\n\\- **Scope 3 emissions** are the indirect emissions from transporting your products to the point of sale, your employees' business flights and commutes, the raw materials you use in your products...\n\nTo facilitate your carbon emissions inventory, start with a simplified list of your company's business physical flow:\n\n- Operations (e.g.: buildings, employee and visitor mobility, product output)\n- Energy sources\n- Supply chain activities (raw materials and distribution)\n\nInclude your Scope 3 emissions in your inventory from the start, even if you think it will be difficult to properly collect all the relevant quantitative data. At least you will have a qualitative overview of your carbon emissions inventory. You may then decide to start with a partial Scope 3 calculation for the first few years and then gradually include the full inventory.\n\nThis baseline overview of your carbon emissions inventory will be your starting point for defining the next steps for data collection and management.\n\n[Read more](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/solutions-new/15-01-001)\n\nStep 2: Choose a Carbon Footprint Calculator / ESG Management Platform\n\nCost\n\nC1\n\nCost\n\nC1\n\nCost\n\nC1\n\nEFFORT\n\nE1\n\nEFFORT\n\nE1\n\nEFFORT\n\nE1\n\nIMPACT\n\nI2\n\nIMPACT\n\nI2\n\nIMPACT\n\nI2\n\nTo compile all the data for company level reporting, you will need **to choose a methodology and build or use an existing carbon footprint calculator or ESG Management Platform**. There are free software tools available online to help your company understand and calculate the emissions from its own operations, as well as ESG Management Platforms.\n\nHere is an overview of the criteria to consider before choosing which tool to use:\n\n**1/ Reporting standards and methodologies**\n\nDepending on your reporting objectives, you may need to choose a specialised tool that allows you to follow standards for regulatory compliance (e.g. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol) or to integrate your carbon footprint management into a broader sustainability reporting, such as ISO management.\n\n**2/ Training and certification**\n\nIt is important to take the time to be properly trained on the chosen tool. You will need to check what type of training is available.\n\n‍\n\nPlease note that:\n\n- Your carbon footprint methodology must cover all direct and indirect emissions (at least Scope 1 & 2 in the first year) and include an action plan for reduction.\n- It must be carried out by a trained professional in order to be certified.\n\nTo take your journey further, it is advisable to have a trained project leader in-house or to be accompanied by specialists.\n\nSee some online calculators below and more on [The Matcha Initiative toolbox](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/resources/fundamentals/tool-box). Many ESG Management apps are also now available. Some are listed below in the suppliers section and more in our [supplier directory](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/tmi-solutions/suppliers-directory).\n\n‍\n\n[Read more](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/solutions-new/15-01-002)\n\nStep 3: Collect data & emission factors\n\nCost\n\nC1\n\nCost\n\nC1\n\nCost\n\nC1\n\nEFFORT\n\nE2\n\nEFFORT\n\nE2\n\nEFFORT\n\nE2\n\nIMPACT\n\nI3\n\nIMPACT\n\nI3\n\nIMPACT\n\nI3\n\nOnce you have mapped your activities and selected the appropriate tool, you will **focus on collecting data activities and emission factors** to measure carbon emissions.\n\n**\\# Data activities**\n\nYou can try to identify the best available data or proxy to do this, and think about how to improve the measurement later. Accuracy is not the primary objective here: a range may be sufficient to enable you to identify the key levers for reducing your carbon footprint. Make sure you define and document your methodology for measuring your carbon footprint baseline, so that you can monitor and fine tune your future reduction action plan.\n\n**\\# Emission factors**\n\nYou can start with default emission factors from the [UN Emission Factor Database (EFDB)](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/EFDB/main.php) which takes into account the [2006 IPCC Guideline for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/) and its supplements among others. The Singapore grid emission factor used in the calculation is based on grid emissions published annually by the Energy Market Authority (EMA).\n\nThroughout the process, you will identify areas for progress in data collection and emission factor definitions. Of course, improving your carbon footprint measurement methodology could be part of your future carbon management action plan!\n\nTo complete this step, it may be useful to obtain a carbon assurance statement from a third party to verify the accuracy of the GHG emissions data.\n\nSee some emission factors databases below and more on [The Matcha Initiative toolbox](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/resources/fundamentals/tool-box).\n\n[Read more](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/solutions-new/15-01-003)\n\nBuddies - Experience sharing\n\nThe « sustainability journey » may feel overwhelming sometimes, but you are not alone.\n\nOur Buddies have tried, succeeded, failed to implement change in their companies.

Now, I guide organizations through complex transformations — agile, sustainability, and AI — by fostering human-centric approaches and systemic understanding. I'm passionate about evolving leadership to navigate our increasingly technological and interconnected world responsibly.\n\nI am absolutely convinced that the solutions to our current global predicaments do not primarily lie in \"doing\" more or focusing solely on actions. Instead, I believe the answers are found in our \"beingness\" — our mindsets and underlying belief systems. Addressing our challenges effectively requires a fundamental shift in consciousness. Once that internal shift occurs, the right actions will naturally follow. Simply starting with \"doing\" or concentrating too much on technical solutions, without this deeper shift, won't lead us to the desired outcomes.\n\n[palo-it.com](https://www.palo-it.com/en/)\n\n[Read More](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/buddies/sylvain-mahe)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ec1fa9d6f5811ed09b4b2df/684681d239ead81d4ff6cb63_IMG-20250331-WA0009(1)%20-%20Kruthika%20Eswaran.jpg)\n\nKruthika Eswaran\n\nClimate Change Researcher and Consultant\n\nMy primary interest lies in understanding how we can combine green and digital transformations to improve climate resilience.
