You don't have to do everything at once. Take it one step at a time, choosing the actions that are right for you, your business, your assets and equipment, your location, your goals, your budget. Not all solutions work for everyone. Think efficiency and electrification first, phase out fossil fuels and coal if you have not already done so. Look at the risks and opportunities of climate change mitigation and adaptation for your own activity. You are future-proofing your business.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e940b86961046721a7e92b5/5f1a5ac944901e478b33c069_Down%20arrow%20.png)\n\nCOST\n\nEFFORT\n\nIMPACT\n\n[Reset All](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/find-a-solution/carbon-management-and-carbon-footprint-reduction-strategy-overview#)\n\nThank you!

Improve the energy efficiency of your building & facilities through better insulation, high efficiency equipment (lighting, heating, cooling) and improved processes and behaviours, such as lowering indoor temperatures in cold weather and raising them in hot weather.\n2. Switch from fossil fuels to electricity whenever possible\n3. Connect to urban heating/cooling networks where available, such as the district cooling services in Marina Bay or Jurong Lake District for greater efficiency.\n4. Producing renewable energy on site, with rooftop solar panels or awnings on pedestrian walkways.\n\nThink also about [**energy conservation**](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/resources/fundamentals/energy-conservation-vs-energy-efficiency). The best efficiency is the energy that is not used! In Singapore, for example, the air-conditioning target for offices should be set above 25°C and not less than 8°C below the outdoor temperature: this setting provides healthy thermal comfort for people and reduces energy consumption.\n\nAir conditioning releases other greenhouse gases: efficient maintenance of these refrigerants is key to reducing these specific emissions.\n\nSignificantly reducing the carbon footprint of buildings while improving health and well-being is achievable through\n\n- Collaboration with end users\n- Passive design\n- more efficient lighting\n- heating and cooling equipment\n- electrification and on-site renewable generation to decarbonise the building energy mix\n- innovative materials and nature-based solutions.\n\nA strategic approach is needed to be successful.\n\nYou may want to investigate [ISO 50001 - Energy Management Systems](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/store/en/PUB100400.pdf) for a standardized approach.\n\nIf you are a tenant, you will need to negotiate with your landlord to share data and action plans. You may also want to change location and negotiate a green lease to improve the performance of your buildings. The Building Construction Authority (BCA) has developed a Green Lease Toolkit to help landlords and tenants work together to improve the environmental performance of buildings.\n\nBrowse The Matcha Initiative \" [Green the Office](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/find-a-solution/green-office-general)\" and \" [Digital Footprint & IT](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/find-a-solution/best-digital-practices-energy-reduction)\" for more best practice and carbon reduction solutions.\n\n[Read more](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/solutions-new/15-04-001)\n\nOptimize transportation and mobility\n\nCost\n\nC2\n\nCost\n\nC2\n\nCost\n\nC2\n\nEFFORT\n\nE3\n\nEFFORT\n\nE3\n\nEFFORT\n\nE3\n\nIMPACT\n\nI3\n\nIMPACT\n\nI3\n\nIMPACT\n\nI3\n\nAs described in the IPCC report, \\[companies\\] can reduce direct (tank-to-wheel) greenhouse gas emissions from passenger and freight transport by:\n\n1. avoiding travel: local procurement, reducing the frequency of meetings and increasing the use of videoconferencing, limiting the number of kilometres travelled per employee, ...\n2. switching to lower carbon transport systems: reducing energy intensity by using more energy efficient means of transport, switching to lightweight materials, ...\n3. reducing the carbon intensity of fuels: replacing oil-based products with products from low greenhouse gas sources.\n\nHere are some examples of decarbonisation measures to reduce emissions from transport & mobility:\n\n**Goods & products Freight transport**:\n\n- Use low carbon delivery and distribution options, e.g. electric vehicles, biofuel or alternative fuel trucks, shared/consolidated shipping...\n- Optimise last mile delivery to reduce km per order\n\n**Stakeholders mobility:**\n\n- Promote lower carbon business travel options and low carbon business vehicles (electric cars)\n- Encourage online meetings and working from home\n- Promote lower carbon transport options for employee commuting\n- Incentive employees to purchase electric cars or bicycles for personal use\n\n[Read more](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/solutions-new/15-04-002)\n\nDecarbonise your products & services\n\nCost\n\nC3\n\nCost\n\nC3\n\nCost\n\nC3\n\nEFFORT\n\nE3\n\nEFFORT\n\nE3\n\nEFFORT\n\nE3\n\nIMPACT\n\nI3\n\nIMPACT\n\nI3\n\nIMPACT\n\nI3\n\nOptimize processes, products and services.

You probably know your own manufacturing process very well. As part of your analysis, you could measure the resources you use such as water and energy, brainstorm with your engineers to generate new ideas to optimise the process, evaluate alternatives or identify specific R&D areas.\n\nTo be successful in driving change, awareness and engagement of your team will be key at every stage.\n\n‍\n\nHere are some examples of decarbonisation actions for your product/service:\n\n\\- Eco-design to reduce the amount of water and energy used during the lifecycle of products (including the usage phase), and to reduce waste disposal at the end of life.\n\n\\- Implement Circular Economy initiatives (e.g. waste reduction, recycled materials for packaging, leasing of machinery)\n\n\\- Purchase lower carbon goods/services/materials (e.g. low carbon food ingredients if you are a food business)\n\n\\- Increase repairability to extend the life of products sold.

A commitment to reducing emissions from the value chain is still highly relevant, and it is worth working with suppliers and taking action to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nHowever, setting quantified targets to reduce Scope 3 emissions and monitoring progress can require extensive data collection and analysis, which is often beyond the resources of smaller companies.\n\n**You may, therefore, start by making sure you have** [**a sustainable procurement policy**](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/resources/fundamentals/how-to-write-a-sustainable-procurement-policy) **.** Then a qualitative approach, such as Tier 1 supplier audits, may be advisable.
