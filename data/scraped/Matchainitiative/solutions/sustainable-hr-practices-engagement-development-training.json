As a result, helping your staff to grasp quickly the main sustainability concepts is of vital importance.\n\nOrganise talks from specialists, movies/documentaries screenings, workshops....

This will empower people to have a “can-do” attitude and help your action be understood better by everyone.\n\nBrowse our [sustainability week kit](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/resources/fundamentals/sustainability-week-kit) to find ideas for raising awareness.\n\nBrowse our [toolbox](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/resources/fundamentals/tool-box) for ideas of movies / documentaries. \\[some ideas for movies: an inconvenient truth, the biggest little farm, tomorrow, movies with WWF ....... \\]\n\nTo let all know, use:\n\n- Sharepoint-like platforms (a web-based collaborative platform)\n- Collaborative tools (dedicated Slack/Teams channels, Trello boards, Internal Forums…)\n\nUse your Employee Resources Groups (ERG) as a channel to promote awareness and actions across your company (see solution below \"Promote Team Building\")\n\n[Read more](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/solutions-new/14-03-002)\n\nInvest in Training & Learning - BASIC\n\nCost\n\nC2\n\nCost\n\nC2\n\nCost\n\nC2\n\nEFFORT\n\nE2\n\nEFFORT\n\nE2\n\nEFFORT\n\nE2\n\nIMPACT\n\nI2\n\nIMPACT\n\nI2\n\nIMPACT\n\nI2\n\nImplementing sustainable practices implies a systemic change in companies, and it becomes critical to prepare our staff in terms of change management, agile thinking, creativity (\"think out of the box\"). In a  fast pace changing world, upskilling employees and allowing them to build and adapt their knowledge through personal training, is a critical asset.\n\nSustainability also requires expertise so **you need to train each department team on its specific role**. For example:\n\n- Train the procurement team on sustainable procurement, ESG, carbon management and climate change,\n- Finance team should be upskilled in carbon management & sustainability accounting,\n\nYou can allow your employees to **access e-learning on a on-demand basis**:\n\n- Invest in your employees to continuously improve their skills or develop new ones. You will allow them to remain on top of their games, with more options in their hands.\n- You can use external online learning platforms to help with your employees general upskilling, both in hard and soft skills. Note that these platforms can also be used to raise awareness of your employees on sustainable matters such as: SDG 17, sustainable initiatives, inclusion & diversity, environmental technical issues and certifications \\[Green Mark, Heath & Security...\\] etc...\n\nBuild a **knowledge repository of your core processes**, the way you do things:\n\n- It helps you to build a sustainable way of learning what matters, what makes the success of your company.\n- It ensures clarity & consistency in the way your employees do things as well as support your new joiners, newly promoted employees in their journey of acquiring new skills\n\nTrain your staff and offer them opportunities to develop their soft skills such as: change management, critical thinking, problem solving, agility, initiative, resilience, flexibility, disruptive design, systemic change. According to the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/top-10-work-skills-of-tomorrow-how-long-it-takes-to-learn-them/), 50% of all employees will need reskilling by 2025. Developing these soft skills will ensure their long term employability remains high.\n\nDigitalise your trainings as much as possible, make them easy to follow in shorter length. You may be eligible to grants from governments.

He gave us perspective on our place in a much bigger ecosystem.\n\nAt that time, we didn’t describe our family as “sustainable”. It was very pragmatic, we didn’t waste anything, we mended everything, saved and reused, because we just couldn’t afford not to :)\n\nIn 2018 in Singapore, after what felt like a long, unfulfilling professional tunnel on autopilot, I was forced to make a pause and took the opportunity to consider what I really wanted to do with my life (I know this resonates with many!)\n\nThen I really realised how passionate I was about sustainability and for the first time, I considered making it my job. Nothing is easy when you don’t hold the right degrees or the right amount of money, so I co-created The Matcha Initiative to jump into action instead of procrastinating.

Now, I guide organizations through complex transformations — agile, sustainability, and AI — by fostering human-centric approaches and systemic understanding. I'm passionate about evolving leadership to navigate our increasingly technological and interconnected world responsibly.\n\nI am absolutely convinced that the solutions to our current global predicaments do not primarily lie in \"doing\" more or focusing solely on actions. Instead, I believe the answers are found in our \"beingness\" — our mindsets and underlying belief systems. Addressing our challenges effectively requires a fundamental shift in consciousness. Once that internal shift occurs, the right actions will naturally follow. Simply starting with \"doing\" or concentrating too much on technical solutions, without this deeper shift, won't lead us to the desired outcomes.\n\n[palo-it.com](https://www.palo-it.com/en/)\n\n[Read More](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/buddies/sylvain-mahe)\n\n[Australia](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/australia)\n\n[Cambodia](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/cambodia)\n\n[Canada](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/canada)\n\n[France](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/france)\n\n[Germany](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/germany)\n\n[Hong Kong](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/hong-kong)\n\n[India](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/india)\n\n[Indonesia](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/indonesia)\n\n[Italy](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/italy)\n\n[Japan](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/japan)\n\n[Mainland China](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/china)\n\n[Malaysia](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/malaysia)\n\n[Netherlands](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/netherlands)\n\n[New Zealand](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/new-zealand)\n\n[Philippines](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/philippines)\n\n[Portugal](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/portugal)\n\n[Singapore](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/singapore)\n\n[South Korea](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/south-korea)\n\n[Spain](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/spain)\n\n[Taiwan](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/taiwan)\n\n[Thailand](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/thailand)\n\n[Turkey](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/turkey)\n\n[UAE](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/uae)\n\n[USA](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/usa)\n\n[United Kingdom](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/united-kingdom)\n\n[Vietnam](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/vietnam)\n\n[Worldwide](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/worldwide)\n\n [![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e940b86961046721a7e92b5/5f1a4135b06874022490fd3f_Back-to-top%20arrow.png)](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/find-a-solution/sustainable-hr-practices-engagement-development-training#SubCategory-Introduction)",
