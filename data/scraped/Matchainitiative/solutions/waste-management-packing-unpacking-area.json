    "overview": "The quantity of waste produced by packaging is an important one. For example, plastic packaging represents 26% of the total volume of plastics used (Ellen Mac Arthur Foundation). Most of the time the use of pallets or cardboard as packaging is not well optimized and this results in an important amount of waste being created. Companies that aim to be more sustainable should tackle this issue and take action to reduce packaging waste and better manage it. It will also result in cost savings.",
