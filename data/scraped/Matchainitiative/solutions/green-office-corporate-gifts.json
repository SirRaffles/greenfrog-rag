  "introduction": {
    "problem": "Typical corporate gifts and freebies (pens, hand fans, sticky notes, lanyards, magnets…) often have in common to be cheap in quality and either useless, thrown away within hours or forgotten in a drawer.",
    "philosophy": "We believe that this unsustainable practice should be banned or replaced with a more valuable approach",
    "key_questions": [
      "Are those bulk-bought gifts necessary in the first place?",
      "Can they be used and reused again, then repurposed/ recycled?",
      "Are they less harmful in terms of material, production, packaging?"
    ],
    "benefit": "Sustainable practices also improve internal and external brand reputation (beware of Greenwashing though)."

      "message": "For your next corporate gift to clients or to your team members, think different. Most corporate and promotional gifts sadly end up in the waste bins.",

      "cost": "C1",
      "effort": "E1", 
      "impact": "I1",
      "approach": "If goodies are unavoidable, choose eco-friendly or sustainable options (recyclable or biodegradable material). It is a good way to promote your CSR strategy to your customers. Choose meaningful gifts that will actually be used, don't waste resources and money with pointless items that will be thrown right away.",
      "caution": "Be careful not to choose gifts that have been offered too much those past years like water bottles or resusable bags. Ask yourself the question: 'will this gift be useful for my customers or my employees, even if they already have 5 of them?'.",
      "quantity_quality": "Act on quantities & quality (e.g. distribute 1,000 recyclable/ eco-friendly pens versus 2,000 made in a distant country and imported by plane)",
      "local_sourcing": "Buy locally to limit transportation and logistics",
      "manufacturer_criteria": [
        "safe work environment to prevent work accidents and illness",
        "employees wellbeing",
        "ethical work conditions (minimum salaries levels, no forced labor, no child work...)"
