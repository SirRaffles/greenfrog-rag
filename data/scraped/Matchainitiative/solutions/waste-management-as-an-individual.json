    "overview": "We are a B2B Platform and focus on companies, yet while working on the waste management solutions, we ended up asking a lot of questions to our experts on our waste as individuals. The average recycling rate for individuals in Singapore was only 17% in 2019 and therefore, we, as individuals, can make a difference.",

Key insights: re-usable plastic bags are the best environmental option in Singapore (provided reused over 50 times), biodegradable products are often NOT a good solution at home because they need industrial composting, glass/cardboard/metals/hard plastics collected in blue bins are sorted at MRF and sent to overseas recycling plants, soft plastics currently get incinerated in Waste-to-Energy plants, first solution is to REDUCE usage."

It has strictly no value for waste-to-energy strategy as food waste is mainly composed of water and requires a lot of energy to burn. First, make sure we order or cook what we need to significantly decrease waste. Second, by composting waste (at least the veggie part), we can decrease food waste sent to incineration."
