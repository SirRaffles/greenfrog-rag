  "introduction": {
    "importance": "Food & Drink sourcing is a key component of a sustainability strategy in the F&B industry and leads to many benefits such as reduced operating costs, improved products quality, improved community relationships, increased customer loyalty, and improved morale and loyalty among staff.",
    "carbon_impact": "Our diet and food choices have a significant impact on our carbon footprint (25% of global GHG emissions are generated by food production).",
    "local_sourcing_reality": "It is fundamental to understand that 'consuming local' will not by itself be enough to reduce our footprint, as Transport only contributes less than 10% of GHG emissions for most food products (falling to 0.5% for beef, because of its tremendous amount of GHG generated by land use and farm-stage emissions). However, it really does matter to avoid products that are air-freighted (because highly perishable) instead of imported by boat and to source from sustainable farms/companies.",
    "key_recommendation": "If you have 1 first step to make, reducing beef and dairy consumption and shifting to poultry and plant-based alternatives will have the greatest impact on your carbon footprint.",
