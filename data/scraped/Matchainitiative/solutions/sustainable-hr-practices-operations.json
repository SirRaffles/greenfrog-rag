      "description": "HR operations can generate a lot of paper. Remember that e-signature on official documents is recognised in Singapore, ensuring you do not take a legal risk on important documents. Opt for e-solutions whenever possible, like e-contracts, e-payslips, e-reimbursements to avoid unnecessary printing and life long storage (for both the company and the employees). Promote self service rather than providing by default a lot of policies, documents, etc.. Store the documents your employees need to access to on a repository / intranet where they can easily consult them.",

      "description": "Decrease business trips frequency & favor longer stays. Continue using videoconference as much as possible. Incentivize your employees to travel less by setting up objectives in terms of travels (example : max 2 regional flights per month...). Invest the savings made in other areas (brainstorm ideas with a sustainable give back outlook). Measure and offset the travels' Carbon Footprint of your employees travelling abroad or relocating. Offset the CO2 emissions with some mechanisms (example : Plant a tree for each longhaul flight, or for each tradeshow you exhibit). When relocating, favor to use recycled boxes for packing and shipping option (less emissions) than air freight.",
