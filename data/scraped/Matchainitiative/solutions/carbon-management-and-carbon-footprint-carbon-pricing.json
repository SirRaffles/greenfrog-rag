Carbon pricing reduces both the carbon intensity of energy supply and overall energy demand through a clear price signal.\n\nThere were [64 carbon pricing initiatives](https://ourworldindata.org/carbon-pricing#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20around%2012%25%20of,by%20each%20in%20the%20chart) in place in 2021, half of which are carbon taxes and half of which are emissions trading schemes.\n\n- A carbon tax puts a price on the emission of one tCO2e. The report of the High-Level Commission on Carbon Pricing identified a [range of 50-100 USD/tCO2e](https://www.carbonpricingleadership.org/report-of-the-highlevel-commission-on-carbon-prices) (or \"carbon price corridor\") as the price needed by 2030 to keep global warming below 2°C as part of a comprehensive climate policy package.  In 2021, a survey of 30 climate economists (Reuters) estimated that the [carbon price should be at least 100 USD/tCO2e or higher](https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/carbon-needs-cost-least-100tonne-now-reach-net-zero-by-2050-2021-10-25/) and needed immediately to incentivise net-zero emissions by 2050.\n- Emissions trading systems (ETSs) allocate allowances to covered sectors on an annual basis through a 'cap and trade' system, which diminish over time. They therefore represent a right to emit. Some of these rights can be traded between parties through carbon markets. In Europe, recent EU ETS price increases have coincided with several significant policy changes and proposals, rising from €4/tCO2e in 2015 to €96/tCO2e in 2021.\n\nCarbon border adjustment mechanisms are also emerging to ensure competitiveness in countries with high carbon taxes and to avoid the risk of emissions being shifted from one location to another (known as carbon leakage).\n\n[Read more](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/solutions-new/15-06-001)\n\nConsider an internal carbon pricing\n\nCost\n\nC1\n\nCost\n\nC1\n\nCost\n\nC1\n\nEFFORT\n\nE3\n\nEFFORT\n\nE3\n\nEFFORT\n\nE3\n\nIMPACT\n\nI2\n\nIMPACT\n\nI2\n\nIMPACT\n\nI2\n\nAs part of their net zero strategy, companies can [use internal carbon pricing to assign a monetary value to carbon emissions](https://cdn.cdp.net/cdp-production/cms/reports/documents/000/005/651/original/CDP_Global_Carbon_Price_report_2021.pdf?1618938446). CDP's 2021 Global Carbon Price Report highlights that to implement an effective internal carbon price, four dimensions should be considered:\n\n- price level (height)\n- GHG emissions coverage (breadth)\n- influence (depth)\n- time.\n\nThe internal carbon price is one tool that can provide insight into the resource allocations and trade-offs the company will face in implementing its net zero strategy. As with any tool, the effectiveness of the internal carbon price will need to be evaluated over time.\n\nFor finance department, it is a good decision-making tool to understand the potential impacts of external carbon pricing schemes and regulations. ICP varies by region and sector. As a quick-win, post the calculations of footprint, you can [assign USD 100](https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/carbon-needs-cost-least-100tonne-now-reach-net-zero-by-2050-2021-10-25/) as a representative initial cost for every tonne of CO2e emitted (this is the carbon price level needed to incentivise net zero emissions by 2050 - [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/carbon-needs-cost-least-100tonne-now-reach-net-zero-by-2050-2021-10-25/)).

My parents used to bring us to the park to have some outdoor activities and that’s where my father taught my siblings and I to observe, love and respect nature. He gave us perspective on our place in a much bigger ecosystem.\n\nAt that time, we didn’t describe our family as “sustainable”. It was very pragmatic, we didn’t waste anything, we mended everything, saved and reused, because we just couldn’t afford not to :)\n\nIn 2018 in Singapore, after what felt like a long, unfulfilling professional tunnel on autopilot, I was forced to make a pause and took the opportunity to consider what I really wanted to do with my life (I know this resonates with many!)\n\nThen I really realised how passionate I was about sustainability and for the first time, I considered making it my job. Nothing is easy when you don’t hold the right degrees or the right amount of money, so I co-created The Matcha Initiative to jump into action instead of procrastinating. That’s how you start an amazing experience with amazing people :)\n\nCherry on the cake: TMI helped me land my current job at Handprint, where we help businesses embrace the next step - Regeneration.\n\n[handprint.tech](https://handprint.tech/)\n\n[Read More](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/buddies/mimi-nguyen)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ec1fa9d6f5811ed09b4b2df/6348cf27dfa2586e669399dc_mei%20yee%20(2).jpeg)\n\nMei Yee Chan\n\nSenior Programme Manager - TÜV SÜD\n\nAs the Senior Programme Manager for Sustainability Validation and Verification at TÜV SÜD, Mei Yee helps organisations add credibility and assurance to their greenhouse gases (GHG) emission assertations and GRI reports by providing third-party verification reports to support organizational claims.\n\nShe has six years of experience in the standards development of ISO 30500 and ISO 31800, testing, and certification for non-sewered sanitation systems.
