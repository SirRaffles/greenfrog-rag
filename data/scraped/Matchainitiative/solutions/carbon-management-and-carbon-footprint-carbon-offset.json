When dealing with carbon credits the quality of the credits is essential to avoid greenwashing and reputational risk.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e940b86961046721a7e92b5/5f1a5ac944901e478b33c069_Down%20arrow%20.png)\n\nCOST\n\nEFFORT\n\nIMPACT\n\n[Reset All](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/find-a-solution/carbon-management-and-carbon-footprint-carbon-offset#)\n\nThank you!

One REC represents one megawatt hour (MWh) of electricity generated from a renewable energy source and delivered to the grid.\n\nPurchasing RECs allows you to retrospectively classify the energy you use from the grid as clean and renewable and offset Scope 2 emissions: this enables your company to green its electricity mix from the grid and reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nQuality credits are key. In October 2021 Singapore introduced a new national standard to enhance the credibility and accountability of RECs used to make renewable energy claims in the country - [Singapore Standards (SS) 673 on the Code of Practice for RECs](https://www.ema.gov.sg/media_release.aspx?news_sid=20211026xnJX3nGtlY4p)\n\n**_Note:_** _If you produce renewable energy in excess of your own consumption (for example, through rooftop solar panels), you can sell the excess energy to the grid and generate an income from the issuance of renewable energy certificates._\n\n[Read more](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/solutions-new/15-05-004)\n\nBuy certified carbon credits\n\nCost\n\nC3\n\nCost\n\nC3\n\nCost\n\nC3\n\nEFFORT\n\nE2\n\nEFFORT\n\nE2\n\nEFFORT\n\nE2\n\nIMPACT\n\nI3\n\nIMPACT\n\nI3\n\nIMPACT\n\nI3\n\nTo offset your remaining hard-to-abate emissions, you can buy **carbon credits**. One credit is meant to offset 1 metric tonne of CO2e. Carbon credits are generated by projects around the world that avoid or remove GHG from the atmosphere, such as reforestation programmes. These projects do not have to be related to your business or located in your own geographical area. Once you buy a carbon credit, it is permanently retired and can't be reused.\n\n‍\n\n**Carbon credits are usually certified** under an internationally recognised carbon standard (third party agencies for voluntary carbon markets, or governments for compliance markets). The quality of the carbon credit is very important to avoid double counting, ensure additionality, permanence, etc...\n\nCertified Carbon offsetting schemes are run by standard-setting organisations that provide assurance and authenticity for high quality carbon credits. They play a key role in facilitating the flow of carbon credits between the offset project (originator) and the corporate buyer (end-user). Credits can be issued by international, national or independent crediting mechanisms.\n\nIndependent carbon offset programmes with the highest issuance are: [American Carbon Registry](https://americancarbonregistry.org/), [Climate Action Reserve](https://www.climateactionreserve.org/), [Gold Standard](https://marketplace.goldstandard.org/collections/projects), [Verra's Verified Carbon Standard](https://verra.org/project/vcs-program/), [Plan Vivo](https://www.planvivo.org/) and the [Global Carbon Council](https://www.globalcarboncouncil.com/). Check also the [UN Carbon Offset Platform](https://unfccc.int/climate-action/united-nations-carbon-offset-platform) ‍\n\nIn Singapore, [Climate Impact X](https://www.climateimpactx.com/), launched in March 2022, aims to be a global carbon exchange and marketplace providing access and liquidity to high quality carbon credits.\n\n‍\n\nTo be considered high quality, any carbon offsetting project need to meet a number of quality criteria. You should plan to carry out independent due diligence on the quality of individual credits purchased throughout your procurement process.\n\n‍\n\n**_Note: Carbon credits are different from carbon allowances,_** _although the term carbon credit is used interchangeably for both. While both represent one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, allowances do not come from carbon reduction projects: they are allocated to companies under a 'cap and trade' system such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme - they therefore represent a right to emit._\n\n[Read more](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/solutions-new/15-05-001)\n\nBuy carbon credits\n\nCost\n\nC3\n\nCost\n\nC3\n\nCost\n\nC3\n\nEFFORT\n\nE2\n\nEFFORT\n\nE2\n\nEFFORT\n\nE2\n\nIMPACT\n\nI2\n\nIMPACT\n\nI2\n\nIMPACT\n\nI2\n\nSome carbon credits are not certified by third party auditors or carbon offset schemes, however they are also legit and verified. Some prefer to go with uncertified credits to allocate the most of the credit cost to the offset program, as third party certification of carbon credits can be expensive. This high certification / middlemen price has 2 consequences:\n\n1. only a fraction of the money allocated to positive impact actually reaches the project on the ground. To take into account middlemen's margins, some recommend to buy 4 times more carbon credits than necessary to really offset one's emissions.\n2. only the biggest organisations can afford it, de facto excluding smaller organisations that still need funding to create climate positive actions. Remember you still need to choose the highest quality of credits and projects!\n\nTo be considered high quality, any carbon offsetting project need to meet a number of quality criteria.

Carbon credits only cover avoidance or removal of GHG emissions, even if they claim to have side benefits on local communities and ecoystems.\n\nAn emerging market is that of \"nature credits\": it works on the same principle as carbon credits but you will be able to support a much broader variety of impactful projects, be it environmentally or socially.\n\nNote that \"nature credits\" have multiple names (\"biocredits\", biodiversity credits\"...) and are yet to be standardised in terms of definitions, prices, practices... As for carbon credits, you need to choose high quality projects and partners!

Unlike offsetting, which often involves purchasing carbon credits from external projects, insetting allows companies to take a more localised and proactive approach.\n\n3 benefits of insetting:\n\n**1- Local impact:** While offsetting involves buying carbon credits or investing in projects elsewhere to offset emissions, insetting directs resources to local sustainability initiatives where companies operate. This approach allows companies to actively contribute to environmental and social improvements in the areas where they operate, generating tangible benefits for their local communities.\n\n**2- Increased engagement:** Insetting provides an opportunity for companies to engage more directly with their stakeholders. By investing in local projects that align with their values and goals, companies can foster meaningful relationships with community members, employees and customers. This deeper engagement helps build trust with stakeholders, enhances brand reputation and demonstrates a genuine commitment to sustainability.\n\n**3- Holistic sustainability:** Engagement can go beyond carbon neutrality by addressing a broader range of environmental and social challenges. Rather than focusing solely on offsetting greenhouse gas emissions, insetting initiatives can include initiatives such as waste management, renewable energy and community development. This holistic approach allows companies to address multiple sustainability issues simultaneously, leading to more comprehensive and impactful results.\n\nInsetting can be seen as a complementary strategy to offsetting, and an effective tool for companies to align their sustainability efforts with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n[Read more](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/solutions-new/15-05-003)\n\nBuddies - Experience sharing\n\nThe « sustainability journey » may feel overwhelming sometimes, but you are not alone.\n\nOur Buddies have tried, succeeded, failed to implement change in their companies.

He gave us perspective on our place in a much bigger ecosystem.\n\nAt that time, we didn’t describe our family as “sustainable”. It was very pragmatic, we didn’t waste anything, we mended everything, saved and reused, because we just couldn’t afford not to :)\n\nIn 2018 in Singapore, after what felt like a long, unfulfilling professional tunnel on autopilot, I was forced to make a pause and took the opportunity to consider what I really wanted to do with my life (I know this resonates with many!)\n\nThen I really realised how passionate I was about sustainability and for the first time, I considered making it my job.
