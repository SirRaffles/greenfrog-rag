In a  fast pace changing world, upskilling employees and allowing them to build and adapt their knowledge through personal training, is a critical asset.\n\nSustainability also requires expertise so **you need to train each department team on its specific role**. For example:\n\n- Train the procurement team on sustainable procurement, ESG, carbon management and climate change,\n- Finance team should be upskilled in carbon management & sustainability accounting,\n\nYou can allow your employees to **access e-learning on a on-demand basis**:\n\n- Invest in your employees to continuously improve their skills or develop new ones. You will allow them to remain on top of their games, with more options in their hands.\n- You can use external online learning platforms to help with your employees general upskilling, both in hard and soft skills. Note that these platforms can also be used to raise awareness of your employees on sustainable matters such as: SDG 17, sustainable initiatives, inclusion & diversity, environmental technical issues and certifications \\[Green Mark, Heath & Security...\\] etc...\n\nBuild a **knowledge repository of your core processes**, the way you do things:\n\n- It helps you to build a sustainable way of learning what matters, what makes the success of your company.\n- It ensures clarity & consistency in the way your employees do things as well as support your new joiners, newly promoted employees in their journey of acquiring new skills\n\nTrain your staff and offer them opportunities to develop their soft skills such as: change management, critical thinking, problem solving, agility, initiative, resilience, flexibility, disruptive design, systemic change. According to the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/top-10-work-skills-of-tomorrow-how-long-it-takes-to-learn-them/), 50% of all employees will need reskilling by 2025. Developing these soft skills will ensure their long term employability remains high.\n\nDigitalise your trainings as much as possible, make them easy to follow in shorter length. You may be eligible to grants from governments.
