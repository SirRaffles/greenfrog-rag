  "description": "There is a wider acknowledgement, fueled by the pandemic we have been through since early 2020. In the new normal context, we need to look at employees wellbeing from an holistic perspective since wellbeing and health are crucial to keep your employees happy, supported and engaged at work. Ultimately it impacts their performance and your talent retention.",

      "description": "Emotional health has gained a lot of visibility over the past few years, even more since the pandemic. Because it might not be visible, and in some organizations and cultures less recognised and seen as a factor of weakness (it is not easy to say you are not doing ok), it might be harder to apprehend. Get a clear communication that Emotional health is recognized by the company & leadership (to show that the company supports it and encourage the employees to speak up), share personal stories (so people can relate to it), and build a program to develop a few visible actions, it will help. HR can survey employees on what would make a real difference in their daily life at work, to measure their happiness and well-being level. Direct managers should check on their employees wellbeing on a regular basis, and try to preserve the team spirit through e-drinks or e-breakfast where chit-chatting is encouraged (like talks around the coffee machine). Train your managers to develop their confidence and reduce temptations of micro-managing, that can lead to frustrations, disengagement and potentially harassement postures. A few ideas below that you can implement: Propose an EAP (Employee Assistance Program). This is external and confidential counselling, where your employees can call a professional counseller on a variety of topics and get tailored advice (financial, health, stress, family issues...) Put in place some stress relief activities (mindfulness, meditation, yoga, break room, ...). There is also a few apps that can supplement an on-site approach (sleepio, mindfulness apps... see below) Raise awareness in participating in annual activities such as the mental health awareness month (October)",

      "impact": "I3",
      "description": "Lack of WSH stewardship and good practices can lead to injuries and fatalities, especially in high risk industries such as construction. You can refer to the WSH Act in Singapore which applies to ALL workplaces and spells out the key responsibilities of various stakeholders (including employers, occupiers and employees). Ensure a work-life balance by respecting working hours, not overlapping personal life. You can also define some internal rules, in involving your employees to agree on meetings length, use of video, no-meeting day... As they define what works best for them, you increase your chances the rules are adopted and spread across your company. Some ideas: Plan 25 mns or 55 mns meetings, come with a precise agenda, only involve people you need in the meeting. Say it is ok not to always put your video on (as long as participants remain focused on the meeting). Once a week, work towards a no-meeting day so people can focus on work that requires some focus or just simply take a break without having to be in front of their screen all day (for example, walking allows us to be more creative, so ultimately you give a service to your employees but also to your company). Communicate that no email should be sent during week-ends or late at night. You can add at the bottom of your email the following, to remove some of the pressure of immediate response outside working hours: 'Whilst it suits me to email now, I do not expect a response or action outside of your own working hours'. Depending on your industry, health at work can be an important area of focus, would it be to prevent accidents, develop ergonomy of your work stations, ensure you have the right luminosity,... Some companies can help you to conduct an audit of your security and propose some actions.",

      "description": "Encourage, whenever possible, flexible working & remote work. The pandemic showed us it works in many industries and teams configuration, so why not build on it? With more flexibility, employees are more engaged and productive. On the other side, it does help to reduce time in commuting and CO2 emissions. Ensure your employees move to counter-act sedentarity: propose walking or standing meetings, stairs instead of lift... A mobile massage team can come to your company for massages. It is run by the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped. Give subventions to fitness club / gym subscription. Propose Gym, Yoga, Pilates classes at work / online. Work with some ergonomits to ensure the best setting for your employees",

      "description": "If your company has a pantry or offers some catering options, do select providers that provide healthy options and sustainable practices: Promote healthy snacks and baskets of fruits. You can also offer the options to your employees to have baskets of veggies/fruits delivered at work for them to bring back home. Think about sustainable practices: For example on sustainable packaging, you can invest in some lunch boxes for your employees to use and return in order to avoid single use packaging. After a corporate event, offer the option for your employees to bring back home what has not been consumed or look at alternate options such as blessing of left overs for underpriviledged communities... See our Food & Beverage category for more ideas. Take into account that the pantry is the occasion of informal gatherings that bring extra value: creativity, informal exchanges, team buildings, workshops... With work from Home, employees may be deprived from corporate socialisation. Office time should be about re-connecting and sharing.",

      "description": "Work from office: In the new normal context, move away from the individual desk, to provide a more flexible & enjoyable common spaces & desk-sharing set-up with individual lockers, or at least propose flexi-desks for those who opt for a more flexible home/office week. Be careful that some employees may feel deminished by the lack of personalisation of their office space or easily replacable, so embark your teams in your office space co-creation when possible. Design your office for 1-1 dedicated spaces, or privacy bubbles. Reduce Office noises especially in open spaces or noisy environments. What do you do with your former & old office equipment? Recycle them! See waste management solutions for more tips and see also below suppliers. Work from home: Propose office equipments that are no longer of use to your employees for their home office space. Lease/ finance equipments for those that may not be well-fitted at home (desk, computer, chair, screens...) Contribute financially to the internet subscription",
