    "overview": "An organisation's impact on the world extends far beyond its core operations. In fact, apart from a very few specific industries, the vast majority of businesses' carbon emissions reside in their scope 3. If you look at the upstream value chain right down to the hands of the end user, there are many sustainability measures to consider. In this Sustainable Supply Chain Best Practices Category, we look at how to establish a sustainable supply chain strategy and measure performance, as well as detailing opportunities related to Procurement, Manufacturing, Logistics & Distribution.",

End-to-end covers the entire supply chain process: from product design and raw material sourcing to manufacturing, delivery of the final product and after-sales service (including end-of-life disposal)."
