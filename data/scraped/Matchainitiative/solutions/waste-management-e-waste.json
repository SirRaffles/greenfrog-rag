    "overview": "Digital products contain up to 60 different elements including toxic ones (lead, cadmium, mercury but also PVC, brominated flame retardants...) and rare earth elements (Neodymium, Terbium, Dysprosium, etc.), which pose potential health risks to production workers, recyclers and environmental risks to water supplies near landfills where they are eventually dumped. The technologies used to recover those rare earth elements have been improved over time, as they represent a high resale value. Properly recycling them reduce the risks to harm the environment and the human health, and also the need to mine new raw materials.",
