      "description": "Design sustainable compensation that promotes sustainable behaviours (balance between base / variable). This will ensure your compensation drives the right behaviors (long term development versus short term gains, collaboration versus individualistic behavior). Define your compensation philosophy to ensure pay equity, especially for employees who might have interrupted their career (returning parents to the workforce), minorities (with less access to higher education grade). Take into account the skills needed to complete the job, rather than the years of experience or the diploma. Define a framework for your compensation to ensure correct mapping of your roles and employees, as per the skills and experience needed to perform each job. Run audits on your compensation by gender to ensure gender pay equality and correct gaps. If you feel comfortable, as a commitment to pay equality you can publish internally your salary ranges (minimum & maximum), so each employee knows they are fairly compensated for a given job. If that is not already the case, automate all payment processes to allow for easy and swift payments.",

      "description": "Being clear on how your employees performance is assessed, ensures alignment, clarity and focus on deliverables. Set up sustainable goals, using the SMART system: goals should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-based. Manage performance to support your annual compensation process in a more factual and neutral way (salary increases, bonus, etc...). Adopt a system that is common to your company to ensure equality of treatment. You can add some sustainable goals that support your overall strategy as follows: Number of volunteering hours, Participation to some green initiatives, Diversity hiring / promotion (for leaders)",

See our corporate gifts section for some ideas. Encourage maternity / paternity & family leaves. Initiate flexible working policies that will focus on the outcome rather than the physical presence. Allow your employees to take at least 1 day off, paid, per year to participate in a volunteering activity",

For example, if your company reduces paper by 30%, host a team building fun activity (make your employees pick the prize!). Allow recognition prizes / awards to be given to sustainable initiatives, charities, etc… Design Sustainable goodies / rewards (employee milestones, president's club awards, etc…). Replace objects by experiences (vouchers for movies, meals, etc...) Encourage team recognition on top of individual recognition. Showcase your do gooders & make them visible",

      "description": "Claire has spent more than 20 years in the HR field working in global environments, accompanying businesses in their -always complex!- development and transformations. Working across teams and cultural boundaries, she became passionate about helping teams and leaders navigate through changes and make sustainable decisions for themselves and their teams, balancing the short-term and long-term impacts in organisations. Back in 2016, she added a coaching hat to her HR experience, got trained and certified (PCC-ICF) with the idea that most of the time what employees and leaders are missing is a space to reconnect with what is really important for them, what makes them successful, or on the contrary slows them down. In 2021, Claire launched her own business, combining her Executive HR and Professional Coaching expertise. She is since then, helping organizations and individuals who want to do the \"right thing\" to develop the \"S\" in ESG through sustainable, human-centred HR Practices, development programs and coaching. To really be the change they want to see! She is able to strategize, coach, train and advise in order to improve both long term executive and organizational performance, as well as ensuring that personal growth and well-being are taken care of in a sustainable and authentic manner. She is Hogan, Gallup Clifton Strengths, Individual and Team Coaching Certified. In 2024, she also trained to become a Climate Change Coach, guiding organizations, leaders, and individuals to align business goals with social and environmental responsibility for maximum impact on their climate journey.",

      "description": "I was born in Vietnam and grew up in France in Paris' low income suburbs. My parents used to bring us to the park to have some outdoor activities and that's where my father taught my siblings and I to observe, love and respect nature. He gave us perspective on our place in a much bigger ecosystem. At that time, we didn't describe our family as \"sustainable\". It was very pragmatic, we didn't waste anything, we mended everything, saved and reused, because we just couldn't afford not to :) In 2018 in Singapore, after what felt like a long, unfulfilling professional tunnel on autopilot, I was forced to make a pause and took the opportunity to consider what I really wanted to do with my life (I know this resonates with many!) Then I really realised how passionate I was about sustainability and for the first time, I considered making it my job. Nothing is easy when you don't hold the right degrees or the right amount of money, so I co-created The Matcha Initiative to jump into action instead of procrastinating. That's how you start an amazing experience with amazing people :) Cherry on the cake: TMI helped me land my current job at Handprint, where we help businesses embrace the next step - Regeneration.",
