  "overview": "Sustainability Accounting addresses the need of business leaders to understand how sustainability will impact their ability to create value and provide stakeholders with accurate sustainability information that is comparable over time and with other companies in the same industry. A company's sustainability performance is closely connected to the P&L and can be translated into item lines related to access to market, access to capital, operational savings, and intangible assets such as branding and reputation. Voluntary sustainability reporting is becoming a mandatory part of the Annual Financial Reporting and enforceable by law in many jurisdictions. Sustainability-related, forward-looking information has become crucial for investors and governments, and the role of CFOs and accountants will change in a new era of Accounting for Accountability. The CFO and finance function agenda is evolving from a pure 'accounting for the balance sheet' to 'accounting for the business and value creation'.",
