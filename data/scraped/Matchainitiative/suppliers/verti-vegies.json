  "description": "VertiVegie is a Singaporean Controlled Environment Farming Company. By growing food locally in a controlled environment, they limit crop loss during production, increase shelf life for consumption & substitute imported food which contributes to major transportation and handling food losses. Their vertical farm, powered by on-site solar generation, reduces land use, and their closed loop water systems use 90% less water use than field agriculture. Also, the hydro-nutrition food grade systems allow year round production without soil depletion and degradation.",
