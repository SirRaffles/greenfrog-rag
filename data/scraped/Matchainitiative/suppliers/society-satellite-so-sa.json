We have previously created content around sustainability for BBC as well as different brands across APAC and globally, amongst others. [https://www.bbc.com/storyworks/transforming-cities/jakarta](https://www.bbc.com/storyworks/transforming-cities/jakarta)\n\nWe create content rooted in purpose and impact, aiming to make people fall in love with sustainability such that saving the Earth becomes their second nature, one piece of content at a time. We also act as a satellite for voices that make us feel, think, crave, and act locally and globally.\n\nWe want to help ground-ups in creating their narrative and marketing themselves to encourage support, be it in the form of investment, public awareness, volunteer / participant recruitment or demonstrating to governments how their ground-ups benefit the community / country. We provide support and services for these ground-ups — whether it is B2B for investments or grants, B2C for participation or communicating to government stakeholders as well.\n\n##### Expertise in the following\n\nResponsible Marketing\n\nConsultants\n\nResponsible Marketing\n\nAll\n\nConsultants\n\nGeneral Consulting\n\n[13.00](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/find-a-solution/responsible-marketing)\n\n[16.01](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/find-a-solution/consultants-general)\n\n# Society Satellite (so:sa)\n\n### Climate Change and Sustainability Content Creator\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ec1fa9d6f5811ed09b4b2df/67dcf91bfa6f57de3c762cfb_Artboard%204%20copy%202%402x%20-%20Joyce%20Po.png)\n\n[so-sa.io](http://www.so-sa.io/)\n\n[Worldwide](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/worldwide)\n\n[Australia](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/australia)\n\n[Cambodia](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/cambodia)\n\n[Canada](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/canada)\n\n[France](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/france)\n\n[Germany](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/germany)\n\n[Hong Kong](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/hong-kong)\n\n[India](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/india)\n\n[Indonesia](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/indonesia)\n\n[Italy](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/italy)\n\n[Japan](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/japan)\n\n[Mainland China](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/china)\n\n[Malaysia](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/malaysia)\n\n[Netherlands](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/netherlands)\n\n[New Zealand](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/new-zealand)\n\n[Philippines](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/philippines)\n\n[Portugal](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/portugal)\n\n[Singapore](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/singapore)\n\n[South Korea](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/south-korea)\n\n[Spain](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/spain)\n\n[Taiwan](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/taiwan)\n\n[Thailand](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/thailand)\n\n[Turkey](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/turkey)\n\n[UAE](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/uae)\n\n[United Kingdom](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/united-kingdom)\n\n[USA](https://www.thematchainitiative.com/countries/usa)\n\nAnchored by a global vision and rooted in Asia, we have footprints across APAC.
