  "description": "Responsible F&B, Open Farm Community aims to be a centerpoint at which the various sectors in food service can find solutions for sustainable hospitality. First and foremost a restaurant with a large organic herb garden focusing on indigenous species, they support local farms (as soon to have the first in soil farm in urban Singapore themselves) and believe in the importance of food that is both tasty and relatively healthy. They host green weddings, climate conversations, and masterclasses with artisans who are practicing their craft responsibly. They are a founding member of the F&B Sustainability council here in SG. Open Farm Community recycles, limits single use plastics, as well as water & food waste and optimises electricity usage. Unique delivery drop programs using re-usable plastic bins. The venue sits on a 35,000 sqft of green-land.",
