  "description": "Rejenerate is a small business based on the Sunshine Coast, Australia.  Our mission is to provide tailored consulting and hands-on support to businesses, helping them implement sustainable and ethical practices that drive meaningful change and community growth. This can be achieved via sustainability coaching programs, as an outsourced ESG Lead, through Climate Fresk workshops, and working closely with businesses who are aiming for B Corp Certification.  As a trained B Consultant through B Lab Australia/New Zealand, I am equipped to take teams through the process from start to finish and work with them to ensure continuous improvement.  I offer 1-1 B Corp consultancy or group programs. As a LEED Green Associate and Social Impact Fellow, I offer businesses support in the hands-on practical side of their operations as well as the reporting side, measuring and communicating impact to all stakeholders.",
