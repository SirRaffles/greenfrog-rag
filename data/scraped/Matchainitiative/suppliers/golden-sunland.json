They partner with smallholder rice farmers in Myanmar and provide them with fair work conditions & wages through buyback schemes that ensure fairness and profits. They also use non-hazardous chemicals on the crops (EU standards). They redesigned their rice mill operations in order to repurpose secondary waste into useful by-products and energy, guiding farmer partners on sustainable growing guidelines, upcycling rice-by products, tracking and making visible the carbon footprint of their rice production.",
