  "description": "Roger&Sons is a team of ethical makers and mavericks who craft fine furniture and thoughtful objects. Their work is driven by inquiry, and spans disciplines: furniture, industrial, and product design, as well as woodworking. The team also spearheads The Local Tree Project - an initiative that salvages trees that have been felled for urban development. It rehabilitates these abandoned logs by turning them into durable, future-proof objects and furniture. They reduce their carbon footprint by using local material, keep processes local and minimising shipping as much as possible. As part of The Local Tree Project and the effort to preserve our dying trade, they believe in educating the public, the future generation, key players of the industry and relevant government bodies. They hold workshops as one of their solutions.",
